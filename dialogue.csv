" "[South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. A group of visiting kids in yellow G.G.W.K. shirts stands next to Garrison]
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Garrison:
" "Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people [she walks to the group and smiles] for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame [she frowns], but please, give her your full attention. [to her] Go ahead.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. [cheerfully] How are we all doing today?! [the kids' eyes wander] I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! [Cartman farts]
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Garrison:
" "[angrily] Eric Cartman, you say excuse me!
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Okay.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Garrison:
" "[to the choir teacher] Go ahead.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Children, we are a national choir called, Getting Gay With Kids! We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(This sounds fucking screwed.) [the others laugh]
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Garrison:
" "Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! [to the choir teacher] Go ahead.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir [Pip yawns and Bill notices. Clyde nods off] where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Boy:
" "[steps forward] Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?
"
"03" "01" "Choir Girl:
" "[steps forward] That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen [Kenny sees her and begins to swoon] is made in the rainforest. [smiles back at him. Kenny's in love - ahem, distracted. The camera stays on him]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "So, who wants to join the fun??
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "What if you don't have any rhythm?
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Excuse me?
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "Shut up, fatass!
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "Choirs suck.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Garrison:
" "Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! [sighs deeply and tells the choir teacher] Go ahead.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Well, uh, that's all, really. [the girl picks her nose, smiling at Kenny] So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front.
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. [the other kids laugh]
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Garrison:
" "All right, that does it!!
"

" "[Mr. Mackey's office. Craig isn't sitting on the bench outside, as he usually is.]
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "[behind the door] I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man! [The camera is now inside] You get sent here every day, Craig!
"
"03" "01" "Craig Tucker:
" "I know.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Why can't you behave?
"
"03" "01" "Craig:
" "...I don't know.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "What do you have to say for yourself?! [nothing] Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- [Craig sticks his right middle finger up] Did you just flip me off?
"
"03" "01" "Craig:
" "No.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- [Craig flips Mr. Mackey off again] There! You just flipped me off again!
"
"03" "01" "Craig:
" "No I didn't.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! [Craig hops off the chair as the door opens. The boys enter] Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. [Craig exits]
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "Hey, Craig.
"
"03" "01" "Eric:
" "Ey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Uh, young man, Getting Gay With Kids is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Well, guess what, boys? I think that Getting Gay With Kids is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "What?!
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "You can't do that! [Cartman's jaw drops]
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(Woohoo!) [the boys look at him] (I mean, 'Oh.') [looks down]
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "I think this will be very good for you [writes their names down]
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "But we don't even care about the rainforest.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "And that's exactly why you need to go!
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[drops down and pleads] Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
"
"03" "01" "
" "[Kyle's house, some days later. The Get Gay With Kids bus pulls up to Kyle's house to pick up Kyle, Cartman, and Stan]
"
"03" "01" "Sheila:
" "Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.
"
"03" "01" "Sheila:
" "Oh, I didn't realize.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Boy:
" "Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[as he enters the bus] Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "[As Sharon drags him to the bus] Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
"
"03" "01" "Sharon:
" "Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. [tosses him into the bus]
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "Nooo-ho! [The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Whoopee.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Yeah, pretty much.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Girl:
" "[Kenny sits next to her] My name's Kelly.
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(My name's Kenny.)
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "Lenny?
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(No, it's Kenny.)
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "Johnny?
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(Kenny!)
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "Oh. [looks away and picks her nose.]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Girl:
" "Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[hushed] The nightmare begins.
"
"03" "01" "
" "[The bus rolls along. A map pops up, showing the bus's route, and Latin music plays. It crosses the border at Mexicali, goes down the Baja peninsula, takes a ferry to Mexico and cuts across the North to the Gulf, then snakes down Central America to Costa Rica. They arrive at San José.]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. [the kids move to their windows and look out] Oh! This is so exciting!
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! [Throws open his window and yells] Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, andget a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Eric, sit down!
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[sits] Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? [Kenny looks at him angrily] Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "[to Kelly] (Argh! That's just so untrue.)
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "[picks her nose] Your family isn't poor? [picks her nose]
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Whoa, dude, look over there! [The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.] Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
"
"03" "01" "Redheaded Prostitute:
" "[with heavy accent] What are chu looking at, man?
"
"03" "01" "Middle Prostitute:
" "Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Okay. [pretends] Kugheek! [grins]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Eric, SIT DOWN!
"
"03" "01" "
" "[the bus stops at the Centro Nacional de Costa Rica and all exit]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[rushing out] Oh my God, [covers his nose] it smells like ass out here.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Alll right, that does it! [turns Cartman around] Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[covers his nose again] I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "[in bliss] (Uh-huh.) [Kelly picks her nose again]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Why?
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Eh-heheh!
"
"03" "01" "
" "[inside the Capitol. All seem to be facing the President]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.
"
"03" "01" "El Presidente:
" "[long pause] ¿Qué?
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?
"
"03" "01" "El Presidente:
" "[long pause] ¿Qué?
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "We're the group singing for the Save The Rainforest summit tomorrow? [her head is cocked way to the left by now. El Presidente has no clue. Now the teacher is worried] Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. [faces the kids] Children, do any of you speak Spanish? [Cartman waves his left arm] Don't you dare! [the main door opens]
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "[rushing in] Sorry I'm late.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Oh, no problem. [to El Presidente and his men] Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?
"
"03" "01" "El Presidente:
" "¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest.

"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Yeess!
"
"03" "01" "El Presidente:
" "Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla. [Pablo appears]
"
"03" "01" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. [moves aside]
"
"03" "01" "El Presidente:
" "[long pause] ¿Qué?
"
"03" "01" "
" "[On the Capitol steps]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "[walks over to Kenny, her partner] Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(Yeah, I think so.)
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. [chuckles and shrugs. The people just look. She presses the play button. The kids begin to dance to the music]
"
"03" "01" "The Tape:
" "[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing] There's a place that is magical, and full of rain.
[Women sing] But now it needs help, because it is in pain.
[Men sing] Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore
[All sing] We're spreading awareness like never before!
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle is out of step now]
To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay!
[Bridge. Man sings] Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
[Woman sings] There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world!
[Man joins her] World!
[Chorus. Kids rush into the audience and bring some members back as new partners]
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!
[the kids regroup and Kyle stumbles into place. The tape is stopped and the subjects just walk away]

"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "Thanks!
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "Fuck off, Cartman!
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "[alarmed] No! That's a stereotype.
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. [Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle]

"03" "01" "
" "[End of act one. Time: 8:24]
"
"03" "01" "
" "[Next day, the sun rises over a sea of green, the canopy of the rainforest. The choir teacher and her group are touring with Pablo]
"
"03" "01" "Pablo:
" "This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "God-damn, it's hot out here!
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "[sees a branch] Aaah! Snake!
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "No, dude. That's a branch.
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "Oh. [sees it again] Aaah! Snake!
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "No. That's the same branch again.
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "Oh.
"
"03" "01" "Pablo:
" "[turns and stops the group] The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it.
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[impatient] Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. [Pablo looks at him] We here this a million times back up in the States.
"
"03" "01" "Pablo:
" "Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. [one sits in a tree, resting] Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? [takes a picture]
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey] Bad! Bad monkey! [it screams in pain]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Eric, what the heck are you doing?? [the monkey flees]
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[stops] I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty! and I smack him on the head!
"
"03" "01" "Pablo:
" "And here is a three-toed sloth. [hangs from a branch with all four legs]
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth] It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "[pulls him away] Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[throws the branch at the sloth] Respect my authoritah!
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!
"
"03" "01" "Kids:
" "YEAH!
"
"03" "01" "Choir Boy:
" "I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "What's the Yanogapa?
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!

"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[fed up, buries his face in his mitts] Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!

" "Stanley, what is it?
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "SNAAAKE! [all see and gasp]
"
"03" "01" "Pablo:
" "[standing next to the snake wrapped around a tree trunk] Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature.
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "AAAAAAA! [runs farther back]
"
"03" "01" "Pablo:
" "What's the matter, little boy?
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "He's a little wuss, what's it look like? [Stan is hiding behind some foliage]
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "[lifts some away] I'm just a-scared of snakes.
"
"03" "01" "Pablo:
" "Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. [the snake jumps out of the tree and wraps itself around him, suffocating him] Oh!! [the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls] Agh.
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "[in horror] Oh my God!! [the snake starts swallowing Pablo]
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "[petrified] Jesus Christ, is he dead?! [Pablo's bones come out of the snake's anus]
"
"03" "01" "Stan:
" "Dude!
"
"03" "01" "Kyle:
" "My guess would be 'yes.'
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Oh, no! God, no, no! [spins around] Don't panic, children.
"
"03" "01" "Cartman:
" "[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him] Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! [hurries away, and the snake gives chase]
"
"03" "01" "
" "[The sun sets over the rainforest. The choir teacher now guides the group...]
"
"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Maybe we came from that way. [points to her left] No, nno. Let's try this way. [points to her right and moves that way]

" "[walking behind Kenny] Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "[stops] (Yeah. Everything is fine.)

" "That's good. Can I tell you something?

"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(Okay.)

" "I think I like you. [holds his shoulder]
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(Really?!)
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "[releases] Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(Oh, that's great!)
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "[looks away] No, that's not good.
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "(That's not good?)
"
"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "No. See, if I start to like you too much, [looks away] I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. [looks at him again] Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. [grabs him and gets emotional] And that would devastate me. [lets go] So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! [walks away]
"
"03" "01" "Kenny:
" "[pissed] (Aaaargh!)

"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!

"03" "01" "
" "[The sun sets and the moon appears over the rainforest. Lightning flashes and the camera slowly drops to ground cover]

"03" "01" "Choir Teacher:
" "Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?
"
"03" "01" "A Boy:
" "I'm not.

" "Who's not?!
"
"03" "01" "A Boy:
" "Me.

"03" "01" "Kelly:
" "Benny, will you hold my hand? [picks her nose. When she lowers her hand, Kenny grabs it, but she looks away] I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.

" "Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!

"03" "01" "
" "[Lightning flashes and the group is seen sitting in a row on the ground with Tony Danza visible seated in the middle next to the choir teacher.]

" "No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.

" "[Next day. The sun rises over the Centro Nacional. A rooster crows. A massive stage is prepared for the Save the Rain Forest summit. It looks like an amphitheater, with a scaffold holding ten speakers over the stage and bullhorns atop the pillars. Balloons and a Save the Rain Forest banner are also anchored to the scaffold]

" "[crisp] Who are you?!
"
"03" "01" "Miss Stevens:
" "Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest.

"
"03" "01" "People's Army Leader:

" "[the soldier next to him cocks his shotgun] You white Americans make me sick! [emphasizes his disgust with thumps on the table] You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers.

" "[approaches with a large book] The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her. [displays a diagram of the digestive system] You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas. [the next page is a diagram of the stomach, showing hoe food produces methane] The methane gathers here in the bowel area [shows the intestines, or the bowels], where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart. [shows the colon, where the gas collects and moves out] Should the gas not be expelled, [shows the gas trapped in the bowels] the methane can build up and then ignite, [shows the bowels exploding] leading to... disaster. [shows picture of Jocelyn Wildenstein, then closes the book] Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.

" "You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?

" "[flips between two women] Okay. One, or two? One, or two?
"

" "Uh, one.

" "Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.

" " [squints hard for a better look] Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? [Kyle blinks hard]
"
"03" "03" "Cartman:
" "My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.

" "Why?

" "Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!

" "Why do you have to see an eye doctor?

" "Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.

" "Mr. Derp?

" "Why did Chef quit?
"
"03" "03" "Mr. Derp:

"03" "03" "Cartman:
" "I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. [chuckles]

" "[looks back] Shut up, Cartman!

" "[Chef's house. The boys reach the front door]

" "Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
"

" "Well, it's true.
"
"03" "03" "Stan:
" "But why? Why would you quit?
"
"03" "03" "Chef:
" "Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.
"
"03" "03" "Stan:
" "So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
"
"03" "03" "Chef:
" "No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.
"
"03" "03" "Stan:
" "Talked?!
"
"03" "03" "Chef:
" "Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years  and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.
"
"03" "03" "Woman:
" "[walks up and looks out] Oh! What darling little children.
"
"03" "03" "Chef:
" "Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.
"
"03" "03" "Stan:
" "[ignoring that statement] That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
"
"03" "03" "Chef:
" "Children, Veronica is moving in with me.

" "Moving in?!
"

" "I'm in love.

" "Love?!

" "Oh, you knight. [cuddles Chef]
"

" "What the hell is going on?!
"
"03" "03" "Chef:
" "Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
"
"03" "03" "Veronica:
" "[teasing] Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you.
"
"03" "03" "Kyle:
" "But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
"
"03" "03" "Chef:
" "Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.
"
"03" "03" "Veronica:
" "What's the problem?
"
"03" "03" "Cartman:
" "My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.

"
"03" "03" "Kyle:
" "He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
"
"03" "03" "Cartman:
" "Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
"
"03" "03" "Stan:
" "Wait you guys. [pensive] Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? [the others think about it...]

" "It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.

"03" "03" "Cartman:
" "[seething] All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair [throws a fit] and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!

" "Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.

" "No.
"

" "No.

" "Yes, you did!

" "That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers. [now cautioning] But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.

" "Craig, could I talk to you real quick? [Craig flips him off, and Cartman puts his palms up to calm him] Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
"
"03" "05" "Craig:
" "He did?
"
"03" "05" "Cartman:
" "Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.

" "Eight days tomorrow.

" "And I still don't get any action.
"
"03" "07" "Shelly:
" "I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.

" "But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.

"03" "08" "Pip:
" "Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
"

" "Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. [strokes his chin. All three look around, but the silence alerts Stan]
"
"03" "08" "Stan:
" "[looks back displeased] What?
"
"03" "08" "Pip:
" "Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?
"
"03" "08" "Stan:
" "[grudgingly] What do I have to do?
"
"03" "08" "Butters:
" "Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
"
"03" "08" "Stan:
" "Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.

" "Oh, that's a splendid mission!
"
"03" "08" "Butters:
" "Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! [they go in different directions, but Dougie pauses]

" "Yeah, I know what you mean.
"
"03" "08" "Randy:
" "I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
"
"03" "08" "Gerald:
" "Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar. [brushes it under his nose and sniffs it] Only 'cause I've never smoked before. [picks up a lighter and lights the cigar, then sets the lighter back]

" "What the hell do you want?!

" "Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.

" "So Bosley, what's our next mission?

" "O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
"

" "I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.

" "No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?

" "Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.

"
"03" "08" "Reporter:
" "Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house. [footage of it is shown] According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued.

"03" "08" "Pip:
" "Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.
"
"03" "08" "Reporter:
" "The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks. [choppers and tanks are heard coming in] The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.

" "[as the reporter speaks] Wait a minute [hops off the bed and walks towards the window. He looks out and sees the ATF] Oh my God! [runs back to the others] Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!

" "We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.

" "But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.

[the bear sniffs some more] Don't get too close now, just close enough to throw the net on the stupid bear. [Matthew goes forward with the net. The leader and the other Squirts hide behind some bushes and watch. The leader then barks] Now! [the bear turns to see Matthew and growls, and Matthew throws the net on himself]

" "[uneasy] Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
"
"03" "10" "Stan:
" "Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.

" "Dug her up? Why??

" "Hoh, dear God!

" "[sadly rubs her eyes] Oooh.
"
"03" "10" "Blond:
" "No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it.

" "[helplessly] O-o-o-o-oh!

" "It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like  an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-

" "Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!

" "...Do?

" "Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen.

" "O-o-ogh! [gets up and walks away. The men just sit there]

"03" "10" "Brunet:
" "[to the blond] Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition. [the blond indicates he's thinking by placing his index finger to his lips]

" "Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? [leaves. The watchmen step up]
"
"03" "10" "Brunet:
" "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like. [Alan shows the sketch]

" "Ee-oooh!
"
"03" "10" "Brunet:
" "Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like.

" "They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.
"
"03" "10" "Jonathan:
" "Huh?
"
"03" "10" "David:
" "Pirate ghost would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.
"
"03" "10" "Munky:
" "No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates.
"
"03" "10" "Fieldy:
" "You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.
"
"03" "10" "Jonathan:
" "But that makes them pirate ghosts.

"03" "10" "David:
" "No. It makes them ghost pirates.

" "Pirate ghosts!

" "Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.

" "Pirate ghosts.

" "Then, you'll help us?

" "How should we split up?

" "I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way, [points to his right] and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way. [points to his left]

" "Say, this looks like a clue. [picks up a book: Pirate Lore of South Park, By A.R.R. Robbins] Pirate Lore of South Park. Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates? [something metallic falls]

" "Good idea.

" "How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?

" "We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.

" "Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas.

" "Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.
"

" "It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks.
"
"03" "10" "David:
" "Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts. [shows the flashlight and swabs, then shines the light through the swabs. The pirate ghosts appear in the distance]

"03" "10" "Fieldy:
" "[with some cheese and a cup] Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese. [holds them to his mouth and sounds] Aaaaraargh!
"
"03" "10" "Jonathan:
" "And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels. [genuflects to place the candle between the mirror and the squirrels. A pirate ship appears on the lake]
"
"03" "10" "Chef:
" "Father, why did you go to all this trouble?
"

" "Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!

And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong.

" "[from the Oval Office] My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.

" "I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.

" "Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it.

" "Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.

" "Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?
"
"03" "12" "Mr. Cotswolds:
" "Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise.

" "Mark, where's your sister?

" "Rebecca, don't play that perverted game! [reaches the door and opens it. Before them is Kyle on his back on a low table covered by a blanket. Rebecca, in scrubs, stands on a chair cutting away at Kyle's hat. Both look at her parents]

" "[voice quivering] I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.

" "No no. I mean, go with me.

" "Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.
"
"03" "12" "Cartman:
" "I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. [she looks over and sees the Fonics Monkey tossing a box of Snacky S'mores around. She withdraws and Cartman yawns again. Stan and Kenny enter]
"
"03" "12" "Stan:
" "Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
"
"03" "12" "Cartman:
" "[sleepily] Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.

" "But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
"

" "[sleepily] That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.

" "[voice quivering] Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?

" "Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that... [draws close] flicker of light over there?
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "I... [looks down and away, pulls away a bit] have looked at it.
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children, [draws close] just like us.
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "From public school, your house is just a flicker of light. [they walk over to a stone bench and sit] Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "Well, what else would one do?
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "Love, for one thing.
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "And woowhat is love?
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "Woowhat means ki-iss?
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "Rebecca, in public school, [hops down] we select our... own mate. [walks off a bit] In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss. [he turns to face her] So I cold write about it. [Kyle walks back and sits on the bench] How do we do it?
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "I'm not completely sure.
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "Should we... [looks at him] l-look it up?
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. [she hums as they get closer and closer. Their lips touch. A quick kiss and they pull apart]
"
"03" "12" "Rebecca:
" "Wow. Wow, that was fun! [grabs him]
"
"03" "12" "Kyle:
" "Dah. [she kisses him back, then lets go] Does that mean you'll go to the dance?

" "Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.

"
"03" "12" "Jimbo:

" "[onstage, takes the mic from Dio] Calm down, papá! [Papá looks at Mom] Everything is all right. [the kids look at him] You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on. [his parents listen] Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. [Rebecca is listening]

"03" "12" "Butters:
" "Well, she sure is.
"
"03" "12" "Mark:
" "I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. The men listen]

" "Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.

Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?

" "[thinks] ...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.

" "But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy!

" "M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas.

" "[close-up. He's suddenly scared] Arkansas?

" "What's Arkansasis that a state?
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? [hands them out. Craig reads his sheet.]

" "Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?

"03" "17" "Mr. Mackey:
" "M'kay. [joins Mr. Garrison aside]
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Garrison:
" "Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Mackey:
" "What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Garrison:
" "[wistfully] Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live theremy [stifles a sob] ...father still lives there.

" "Well, don't you want to see them?

"03" "17" "Mr. Garrison:
" "I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay? [walks him over to a chair and sits him down] Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Garrison:
" "...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me.
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Mackey:
" "When was that?
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Garrison:
" "Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Mackey:
" "M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy? [Mr. Garrison begins to cry] Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?
"
"03" "17" "Mr. Garrison:
" "[turns away] Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! [hurries out of the classroom crying]

" "Cartman, what the hell are you doing?

"03" "17" "Cartman:
" "We're trying to find the brown noiseit's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.

"03" "17" "Cartman:
" "That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.

"03" "17" "Kyle:
" "Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!

" "M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?

" "Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!

" "No! No, you moron! [Mr. Mackey gets annoyed] Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!

"
"04" "02" "Agent Sharp:
" "I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered [close-up] a hate crime.

" "...What the hell is a hate crime?
"
"04" "02" "Mr. Mackey:
" "Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-

" "New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense.

" "What? A federal offense?

" "Oh no.

" "Oh no??

" "[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark] Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups.

" "And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler.
"
"04" "03" "Kyle:
" "You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
"
"04" "03" "Stan:
" "Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
"
"04" "03" "Cartman:
" "I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
"
"04" "03" "Kyle:
" "Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.

" "Sounds good.

" "So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. [a Christina Aguilera bug is crawling all over Kenny] Hooray. [looks] Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. [takes his pan and swings it at Kenny. It strikes, and Kenny's face is smashed in. Kenny falls forward, hits the floor, and a puddle of blood forms under him]

"
"04" "03" "Randy:
" "Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
"
"04" "03" "Chef:
" "I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. [puts in the tape. The VCR does the rest]
"
"04" "03" "Dr. Shay:
" "Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder. [three kids are in a classroom setting, acting up. Dr. Shay enters] This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child.
"
"04" "03" "Girl:
" "[Dr. Shay walks up to her and listens as she rattles off] I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara- [he smacks her behind the ear] Ah!
"
"04" "03" "Dr. Shay:
" "Sit down and study! [she looks at him scared, then picks up a book and opens it, looking at him all the while. He moves on to the boy in the middle desk]
"
"04" "03" "Boy 1:
" "Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! [Dr. Shay smacks him too, making him turn aside. He turns back]
"
"04" "03" "Dr. Shay:
" "Sit down and study!
"
"04" "03" "Boy 1:
" "[looks at him, then starts crying] Wwaaahahahahaaha [Dr. Shay smacks him again. The other boy stops and looks]
"
"04" "03" "Dr. Shay:
" "Stop crying and do your schoolwork! [the boy opens his book. He and the girl start reading. The Dr. moves over to the other boy, and he just cracks open his book and reads. The doctor address the camera] If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again. Thank you. [Chef turns the tape off]
"

" "Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.

" "Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.

"

" "Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?

"04" "03" "Kyle:
" "Come, see him with us.
"
"04" "03" "Cartman:
" "Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again! [runs around] She's on my back! Hah! [leaves]
"
"04" "03" "Chef:
" "That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!

" "[South Park Pharmacy, after hours. The pharmacist and the clinic doctor are talking, and the doctor counts some money]

" "Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.

" "That's easily another twenty grand apiece! [the pharmacist laughs and Chef arrives]

"

" "I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
"
"04" "03" "Clinic Doctor:
" "Huh?
"

" "All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!

" "Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-
"

"
"04" "03" "Pharmacist:
" "Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God! [beings to weep as well]

" "Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!
"

" "We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them.
"
"04" "03" "Chef:
" "Then we need an antidote!
"
"04" "03" "Pharmacist:
" "Yes, of course.
"

" "Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?
"
"04" "03" "Pharmacist:
" "I have some right here. [takes a bottle from a medicine case] It's a compound called Ritalout.
"

"
"04" "03" "Stan:
" "No! [steps forward] You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be protected and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!

"04" "05" "Patrick:
" "Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful [Butters lights up], bright, little boy.

" "[rolling reaction] Yeah, m-hm.

" "So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?
"
"04" "07" "KKK Members:
" "[rolling reaction] Right, yeah.
"
"04" "07" "Jimbo:
" "So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.

" "Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?

" "Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-

"
"04" "07" "Mr. Wyland:
" "Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club. [the bleachers are shown. The mayor, Chef, Jimbo and Ned, and others are present] I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the Flag Should Be Changed team. [Wendy hops off her seat, then looks at Cartman and strokes her chin, then steps up to look at the audience. She looks again at Cartman. He's been watching her all the while, wondering where this is all headed]

" "[off camera] Oh, God! [Butters' and Token's jaws drop. So does Chef's. Wendy finally releases the pucker, sighs in happy relief, and goes back to the podium]
"
"04" "07" "Wendy:
" "[confident now] There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. [steps down as people clap. Stan is still in shock that Wendy kissed Cartman. She sits down, Cartman looks at her, then places his hands behind his head in a supreme air of confidence and looks away]
"
"04" "07" "Mr. Wyland:
" "Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point? [Kyle moves to the podium while Stan remains stunned]
"
"04" "07" "Kyle:
" "Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill. [an astonished Stan looks as Cartman puts his right hand on the back of Wendy's chair and points at her with his left, winks, then does a victory hand dance. A smiling Wendy remains oblivious to this showing off] And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing.

" "I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!

" "[minus Stan who's mouth is still hanging open as he stares at Wendy] Racist??
"
"04" "07" "Chef:
" "Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.
"
"04" "07" "Kyle's Team:
" "[minus Stan still shocked] Ooooooohhh.
"
"04" "07" "Chef:
" "Ooooooohhh?!
"
"04" "07" "Kyle:
" "W-we really didn't see it that way.
"
"04" "07" "Chef:
" "But that's a black man up there!
"
"04" "07" "Kyle:
" "Y-yeah, but the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
"
"04" "07" "Chef:
" "Well of course it matters when- [catches himself] Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?

"
"04" "07" "Mr. Wyland:
" "What?
"
"04" "07" "Chef:
" "Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.

" "Yeah. [Cartman is still showing off, Wendy remains oblivious, Stan remains shocked]
"
"04" "07" "Chef:
" "I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.
"
"04" "07" "Jimbo:
" "Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.
"
"04" "07" "Chef:
" "Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.
"
"04" "07" "Jimbo:
" "We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flagsomething that everybody can be happy with.
"
"04" "07" "Chef:
" "I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.

" "She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.

" "Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
"
"04" "08" "Stan:
" "Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
"

" "We have to rehearse all that we can! [moves away] Now, check this out: [returns with a box of clothes and sets it on the floor] My mom made us costumes!
"

" "Costumes? [the band gathers around the box]
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "Yeah. [starts handing out the costumes] This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... [she looks a little embarrassed]
"
"04" "08" "Stan:
" "Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.

" "[looks back blankly] ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--

" "Hey, Cartman, what does fingerbang mean, anyways?
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... [waves his finger around] pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
"
"04" "08" "Kenny:
" "[chuckling] (Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)

" "[testy] Okay, Kenny, what does fingerbang mean, then?

"04" "08" "Kenny:
" "(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)

" "[with a drawl] Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous.

"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "[leading the band members through the mall] Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!

" "You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir.

" "Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again. [Cartman walks off and the others join him. Stan retrieves the boom box. Then] You see, you put your life on the line every day.
"
"04" "08" "Stan:
" "Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
"

" "Nothin'. Just... shopping.

" "Cool.

"
"04" "08" "Manager:
" "[a harried man who's speech is nearly emotionless with odd exclamations] What? Hey. Who are you? [the office is a bit unkempt. Stacks of paper here and there, hanging out of cabinet drawers, scraps on the floor and desk...]

" "We... are Fingerbang!
"
"04" "08" "Manager:
" "O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.

" "You don't think we're any good, do you?!
"
"04" "08" "Manager:
" "No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.

"
"04" "08" "Randy:
" "What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
"

" "Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.

" "I just don't know what I'm gonna do. [lets himself in] Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. [goes to the sofa and pulls out some Cheesy Poofs to eat]
"
"04" "08" "Chef:
" "[sits next to Cartman] Alright, Eric, what's the matter?
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, [with feeling] I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? [the woman sits on Chef's left side and strokes his arm]
"
"04" "08" "Chef:
" "Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "What's the Gomlich effect?
"
"04" "08" "Chef:
" "The law of physics that states, If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming.
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "So how do boy bands use that?
"
"04" "08" "Chef:
" "All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy! [the blonde gets cross and scoots away; Chef quickly makes amends] Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. [she goes sweet on him again]
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "Thanks!
"

" "You're welcome. Now, go away!

" "A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!

" "[outside] Cucumber in the pants. Got it. [and closes the door]
"
"04" "08" "
" "[South Park Elementary, playground, day. Nine kids are there: the five band members and the four other girls in class. Cartman is talking to Bebe, Red, Annie, and Milly. He seems to have taken Chef's advice...]
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God! Okay?
"
"04" "08" "Bebe:
" "Are we gonna get paid now, or after?
"
"04" "08" "Cartman:
" "I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. [Timmy sits in the cameraman's chair]
"

" "Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
"

[the audience claps. The producer is in the second row of spectators. The choir members split up and the producer rushes up to Randy]

" "Kid, can I talk to you?
"

" "Uh sure.

" "Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
"
"04" "08" "Randy:
" "What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
"
"04" "08" "Producer:
" "Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
"
"04" "08" "Randy:
" "Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
"

" "Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
"
"04" "08" "Randy:
" "[interrupting] No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
"
"04" "08" "Producer:
" "I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. [slips a business card into Randy's coat pocket and pats it]
"

" "It's obvious to me, girl

" "The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. [the song continues as he speaks, and the scene changes from the studio, to a poster, to a concert as the camera leaves the poster]

" "[voice full of emotion] And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
"
"04" "08" "Stan:
" "Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
"
"04" "08" "Randy:
" "I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, No! Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world. [Stan is listening] That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley. [bitterness creeps in] It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarrayus, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. [walks off]

" "[thinks, then lowers the magazine] Come here, Stanley. [Stan approaches and sits next to his dad] Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
"
"04" "08" "Stan:
" "Yeah.
"

" "Yeah, what if we haven't?

"
"04" "09" "Cartman:
" "But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
"
"04" "09" "Sister Anne:
" "No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession.

" "You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
"
"04" "10" "Satan:
" "No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, [God scratches behind his left ear] was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April...

" "Well, I just don't know which one to pick.
"
"04" "10" "God:
" "No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them. [Satan listens] And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.
"
"04" "10" "Satan:
" "God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.

" "Bingo. [a fly gets near him and he snaps his tongue out to catch it and eat it]

" "Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?

In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world. [cables reach out from the Trapper Keeper and engulf two computers. The process continues engulfing all of the US] It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind [skulls litter the landscape] and there was nothing the humans could do. [in the distance a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper tower rises] It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans. [people are shot left and right from the Trapper Keeper's weapons] The nations tried everything to stop it. [troops line up and fire at the Trapper Keeper] Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked. [robotic tanks come into view, firing away at the Trapper Keeper] The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them. [DC TK209s approach the advancing armies and fire at them] But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper. [the battle scene fades, and BSM-471 is shown once again on the ground] And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started.

[closes the book] Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, Great Expectations [displays the title] And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, [the town is now shown, with Pip walking up the street from a distance] where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents.

" "The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school.
