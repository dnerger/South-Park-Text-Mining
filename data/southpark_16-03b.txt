"[CNN Conference Room. Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul are standing behind their benches, debating. A loud applause is heard.]
"
"I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way.
"
"I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
"
"What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama.
"
"We faced something much much greater after World War II. [the camera pans to Stan, who is in the audience] We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs-
"
"Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
"
"[offscreen] Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
"
"It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
"
"Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
"
"[going through a hallway with a trolley] Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
"
"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
"
"[in a wooden dark place with two wires on the ground] I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
"
"[The conference room is shown again. The audience applauses as Stan looks around. The Secret Service agents are shown.]
"
"We might have a problem.
"
"What's that?
"
"We just got word somebody might try to Faith Hill this event.
"
"Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch! [raises his fists and walks away. The stage is shown through Stan's angle. Three other agents step on the stage.]
"
"I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this. [Butters takes a plate from the trolley, which has an iPhone on it, and walks to the left. Meanwhile Kenny comes from the opposite direction, taking the iPhone and passing it to Stan.] I got it.
"
"Hey, somebody is under the stage.
"
"Go Cartman! [Cartman runs up and comes on the stage. He cheerfully pulls his shirt out near the nipple area. Stan takes a picture. Four agents come up to chase Cartman.]
"
"[Outside the conference room. Butters, Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman run out.]
"
"We got it. We got it!
"
"Go, go, go.
"
"Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. [The agents run after them.]
"
"[The news]
"
"First, there was planking. [various images of people planking come up] People taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the Internet. Planking was soon replaced by owling. [a picture of a boy with his knees drawn to his chest] And after the super bowl by bradying. [a flag football player as well as an overweight man, both having their hands tight on their crotches while looking down] But the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs. [Cartman pulling out his shirt is shown, this time fullscreen] It's called Faith Hilling. And all around the world people are doing it. [A black boy pulling his red shirt, then a ginger boy with a cap doing the exact same thing with his grey-and-white sweatshirt] Kids, adults, and even notable celebrities are getting into the act. [a Lakers player is shown. The news studio comes to view again.] But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it?
"
"[South Park Elementary, day. The boys are in a wooden room, being lectured by Professor Lamont.]
"
"I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire! [the children are listening to him, Cartman has a bored look] Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.
"
"Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
"
"[lowers the screen] I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across. [projects the film]
"
"[The film. Bloody Sunday: The Dangers of Memeing. A man with an old style hair is sitting in a classroom with a outdated TV and a poster of computer club which has a picture of an old computer]
"
"For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called tebowing.
"
"[Two boys are standing on a sidewalk. One of the boys has an iPhone in his hands.]
"
"[offscreen] This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous tebowing can be.
"
"Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.
"
"I don't know, Ryan, you sure this is a good idea? [Ryan walks onto a railway]
"
"Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second, how could I get hurt? [kneels down and puts his right elbow on his right knee, closing his eyes as well as pinching his nosebridge]
"
"Okay, hold still. [puts up his iPhone. A train horn is heard.] What's that?
"
"A traaain! AAAAAA!
"
"RYAN!
"
"No, no! Nooo! No, no, no, no, noooo! [finally a train comes and hits Ryan, leaving bloody remains of him. Butters screams with terror for what he has seen.]
"
"Ryan!
"
"Learn from me. [dies]
"
"[A couple is travelling in their car in the night.]
"
"This sure is a nice car, Tommy. [raises her iPhone] Would you like to get a picture of me tebowing in it?
"
"Sure. [gets the iPhone to take her picture. The woman poses while the train horn is heard.] What is that?
"
"Oh my God, it's coming!
"
"God no! [comes out of the car] No, no!
"
"[scared] Tommy, d-did you get the picture?
"
"Hold on, wait, hold on! [hurriedly presses on the iPhone, then gets ready to take the picture]
"
"Hurry, hurry! AAAAA! [her husband walks away. She gets crashed by the train, decapitated] Eeeaaah! [The classroom. Butters screams again.]
"
"[A man with a yellow shirt and round glasses is talking on his iPhone.]
"
"Be careful up there, Pete.
"
"[tebowing on a wall with graffiti] Just go on and take the picture. [the wall gets crushed by a train. Butters in the classroom screams.]
"
"[The speaker in the old-fashioned classroom is shown.]
"
"These youths paid with their lives for tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs [puts his index and middle fingers up], bunny ears [raises his arm while keeping the previous gesture] and fake wiener [bends his left arm and leg] Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you, maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future, [a blue screen comes to view while the following words of the speaker gets typed] get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember. [a photo of two teenagers. The following lines are sung] Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. Peace signs, bunny ears, and fake wieners. [the three memes are demostrated by the photos of the teenagers performing them.]
"
"[South Park Elementary. The fourth graders come out, almost all having concerned looks on their faces. Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman and Butters walk together.]
"
"[yawns] Oh, God. That was boring.
"
"(Totally!)
"
"So, what do you want to do now?
"
"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
"
"Oh, that's a good idea.
"
"What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
"
"Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
"
"Well, count me out.
"
"You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
"
"Well, I'm scared. [Craig shows up]
"
"Hey, did you see today's newspaper?
"
"Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
"
"You guys made the front page.
"
"Really? [the boys excitedly run, except for Butters]
"
"[The boys run in a liquor store.]
"
"Dude, we are on the front page!
"
"Yes!
"
"(Yeah, dude!)
"
"Can we get a different pose, please? [hands the clerk two dollars and gets the paper]
"
"What's it say, what's it say?
"
"It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
"
"What? Let me see that. [the newspaper has Cartman's pictured and a headline 'Faith Hilling so 2,000 late']
"
"How can that be? Already?
"
"[reads the newspaper] Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
"
"How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
"
"[continues reading] ""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive.""
"
"Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
"
"[Cartman's computer screen. Various people sitting on their bare butts with their hands down between their legs are shown. Cartman is in front of the computer, with Stan and Kyle on his both sides and Kenny behind him.]
"
"That's all it is? [Kenny moves to the left-hand side]
"
"You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. [shows three other guys' pictures]
"
"But that's stupid. [Kenny moves to the right-hand side] How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
"
"I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage. [shows a couple of more pictures] This has to be stopped, you guys.
"
"[Outside Café Monet, day. A boy is Taylor Swifting in front of the café. Two girls and a boy watch him as the boy pictures him with his iPhone.]
"
"[giggles] Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. [the iPhone screen is shown as Cartman photobombs while Faith Hilling.]
"
"How is this Kyle? This good? [the boy moves away a bit. The other kids are stunned. The boys stand next to them, Kyle having an iPhone in his hands]
"
"Yep, that's great. [glances at the other kids]
"
"[continues moving as the other boy tries to get past him] Cool, these will be good uploads.
"
"Hey, what are you doing?
"
"Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
"
"Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
"
"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
"
"[starts to crawl away] Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else. [Cartman continues to cover his view] [to Cartman] Knock it off!
"
"Why don't you make me? [the boy punches him, Cartman responds by hitting him on the ground. Stan and Kyle begin to punch Boy 1 while Kenny attacks the girls.]
"
" [South Park Elementary, day. The boys are in the wooden classroom again. Professor Lamont brings in a box, then pulls a gun out of it. He loads it with a bullet while the fourth graders bewilderedly watch him.]
"
"Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe. [the boys glance at each other] Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed! [puts the gun on Butters' desk] That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up.
"
"Oh, that's okay. I think...
"
"Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
"
"Yes, sir.
"
"Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
"
"HA?!
"
"Hey! You're following plankers and tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT! [Butters hesitantly puts the gun in his mouth] Everybody take a good look. [points to Butters] This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. You're playing roulette with your lives! [A hawk is heard offscreen. Two men enter the classroom.]
"
"Professor Lamont, we need to talk.
"
"I will be right back. [leaves the classroom]
"
"[The gym. The two men are seated at a table, pulling out files out of their briefcases.]
"
"You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.
"
"Yes, what is this about? [puts his bag on the table]
"
"We need your expertise, sir.
"
"Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?
"
"Another species? What are you talking about?
"
"We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand... [types on his laptop] this. [turns around the laptop. Professor Lamont puts on his reading glasses to look at the screen, which shows various cats with breads around their heads.] Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us.
"
"They're evolving. Cats are evolving. [moves the cursor down to see more pictures]
"
"Sorry?
"
"There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.
"
"We're having a hard time following you here.
"
"[opens a book] Look. In the 70s there was fonzing. [the book page has two people's pictures with their thumbs up] Which replaced the outdated mustaching. [a guy with his index finger above his lips] In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting. [people raising their fists up to the sky] But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s. [the Nazis doing their trademark salute] Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking. [an Ancient Egypt painting]
"
"You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
"
"[walks to the front] If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures, [takes his glasses off] they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. [dramatic music plays]
"
"[The wooden classroom. The only person left there is Butters, who still has the gun in his mouth. He looks around for a moment, then looks down to the gun again.]
"
"[The Cartman house, day. Mr. Kitty is sleeping over her cat tree. The boys come in, Cartman has a laptop in his hands, which shows a picture of Mr. Kitty cat breading.]
"
"Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this? [Mr. Kitty looks at him] You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty. [closes his laptop and approaches Mr. Kitty] Bad Mr. Kitty. [Cartman hits Mr. Kitty with a stick. Mr. Kitty purrs, then paws at him.] Bad kitty! No more memeing! [walks away] Come on, guys. [the boys walk out of the room. Cartman turns his back to scold his cat again] Bad Mr. Kitty!
"
"[The boys come out of Cartman's house.]
"
"Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
"
"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
"
"I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
"
"That's a cool idea
"
"[sighs] (Oh, fuck it, dude.) [walks away]
"
"W-what's the matter, Kenny?
"
"(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
"
"What seems pointless?
"
"(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
"
"Hey! [the boys approach Kenny] Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
"
"(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
"
"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
"
"Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
"
"[Breaking News.]
"
"Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say ""Oh Long Johnson"" on video before getting out of the way.

"
"You ready, you ready?

"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? [hurriedly puts his pants on]
"
"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
"
"He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.
"
"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
"
"Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
"
"Benedict Arnold. [the three boys walk away]
"
"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay? [the boys stop] You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. [Kenny looks down]
"
"Kenny?
"
"[approaches Stan and the other boys] (I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
"
"If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. [he and his friends walk away]

"Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?

"[A news reporter speaking.]
"
"Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival. [walks to a railway] A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it ""reporting"". And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal. [train horn] Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. [gets hit by the train]

"Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.

"Yeah, good idea. [a doctor comes out of the clinic]

"Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine. [giggles] Get it? [goes back to his clinic. A man with a car sounds his horn]

"
"And so in the face of war a little boy reminds us all what being human really means. The message is unclear.
