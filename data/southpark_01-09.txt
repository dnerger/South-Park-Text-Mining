And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,
keeping watch over their flocks by night.
And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them,
and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them,
'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy,
for born unto you this day in the city of
...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace,
goodwill towards men'

And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus."
"Wendy"
"Unh [labored breathing] Oh!"
"Kyle"
"Come on, Mary! Push!"
"Wendy"
"Aaaah!"
"Kyle"
"I can see its head!"
"Wendy"
"UUuuhh-UUuuhh."
"Kyle"
"It's a boy!"
"Cartman"
"Oohhhh!"
"Kenny"
"(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you?"
"Kyle"
"...Sorry."
"Mr. Garrison"
"And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains."
"Wendy"
"Okay."
"Sheila"
"Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head."
"Sheila"
"How dare you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"...So?"
"Sheila"
"So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Because it's Christmas???"
"Sheila"
"Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you?"
"Sheila"
"Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!"
"Cartman"
"Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!"
"Kyle"
"Shut up, fat boy!"
"Cartman"
"I'm not fat, I'm festively plump."
"Stan"
"Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?"
"Sheila"
"How about the dreidel song, bubbe?"
"Kyle"
"I can sing the Mr. Hankey song..."
"Mr. Garrison"
"The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?"
"Kyle"
"
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-

"
"Stan"
"Christmas Poo?"
"Cartman"
"What the hell is Christmas Poo?"
"Kyle"
"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?"
"Sheila"
"Kyle, that is enough!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan."
"Sheila"
"Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh wait wait wait. Was it the pagan remark?"
"Wendy"
"You guys, look! It's snowing!"
"Stan"
"Whoa, Christmas snow!"
"Wendy"
"Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue."
"Wendy"
"It's fun."
"Kenny"
"P'tooui."
"Stan"
"That was sick, dude!"
"Cartman"
"Hey!"
"Cartman"
"What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!"
"Kyle"
"We can, too!"
"Stan"
"...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude."
"Kyle"
"Officer Barbrady!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"What?"
"Kyle"
"Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Yyess."
"Kyle"
"Damnit!"
"Stan"
"Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas."
"Cartman"
"Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents."
"Kyle"
"No. But I get Hanukkah presents for eight days."
"Cartman"
"Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that."
"Stan"
"We'll catch up with you later, Kyle."
"Kyle"
"Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo."
"Stan"
"Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?"
"Kyle"
"Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet."
"Cartman"
"Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now."
"Kyle"
"Well! You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!"
"Cartman"
"You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle."
"Stan"
"See you around, dude."
"Kyle"
"
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas...

"
"Kyle"
"
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas.

"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down."
"Large woman"
"Mayor, we are deeply offended by the Nativity scene in front of the capital office. Church and State are separate!"
"Some men"
"No! Wrong!"
"Kyle"
"What's going on, you guys?"
"Stan"
"The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet."
"Sheila"
"That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"You are the Jewish community!"
"Crowd"
"Yeah! Yeah!"
"Cartman"
"Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!"
"Kyle"
"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
"Father Maxi"
"Mayor, the Nativity is what Christmas is all about. If you remove Christ, you must remove Santa and Frosty and all of that garbage, too!"
"Woman"
"Hallelujah!"
"Man"
"Amen!"
"Tree hugger"
"And we must put a stop to the cutting down of Christmas trees!"
"Man 1"
"Raah!"
"Man 2"
"Give me a break!"
"Uncle Jimbo"
"And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids. If you don't want to spill your coffee, you shouldn't be driving with it."
"Crowd"
"Yeah! Yeah!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise. Perhaps we need a new icon for Christmas."
"Assistant 1"
"Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor!"
"Kyle"
"Hey! How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Ex-cuse me?"
"Kyle"
"Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet."
"Sheila"
"Kyle! Sshhh!"
"Kyle"
"It's true. He doesn't care what faith you are. 
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-

"
"Cartman"
"[stopping Kyle] Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy."
"Kenny"
"(Kyle's crazy!)"
"Stan"
"Yeah."
"Sheila"
"Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww."
"Kyle"
"Wait..."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Yes, Mr. Garrison."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Rats!"
"Gerald Broflovski"
"It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!"
"Sheila"
"Your father's right, Kyle."
"Gerald"
"Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!"
"Sheila"
"Listen to your father, Kyle."
"Gerald"
"Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'."
"Kyle"
"But dad, he always sh..."
"Gerald"
"Say it!"
"Kyle"
"There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey."
"Gerald"
"Again!"
"Kyle"
"There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey."
"Sheila"
"This is for your own good, bubbe."
"Gerald"
"Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!"
"Kyle"
"[softly, under his breath] Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway."
"Gerald"
"What did you say?!"
"Kyle"
"I said Ike's on fire!"
"Ike"
"Oh oh. On flame? Oh oh. On flame?"
"Sheila"
"Oh my God!"
"Kyle"
"It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast!"
"Voice"
"Kyle."
"Kyle"
"I'm not hearing that."
"Voice"
"Kyle."
"Kyle"
"Mr. Hankey?"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Howwwwdy-hoooo."
"Mr. Hankey"
"Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell."
"Kyle"
"[now wary] Go away, Mr. Hankey."
"Mr. Hankey"
"You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers."
"Kyle"
"I said go away! My father said you aren't real."
"Mr. Hankey"
"Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song?"
"Mr. Hankey"
"
Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'.

"
"Kyle"
"Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble."
"Mr. Hankey"
"
Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'.

"
"Gerald"
"Kyle, what are you doing in there?"
"Kyle"
"Nothing."
"Gerald"
"Open this door!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"
I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...

"
"Kyle"
"Mr. Hankey, come here."
"Gerald"
"KYLE!"
"Kyle"
"Say something, Mr. Hankey!"
"Gerald"
"Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!"
"Sheila"
"Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Howdy-ho!"
"Kyle"
"Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?"
"Mr. Hankey"
"You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold."
"Kyle"
"Nobody believes in you, not even my friends."
"Mr. Hankey"
"Aw, gee, that's too bad."
"Kyle"
"Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends."
"Mr. Hankey"
"Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas."
"Kyle"
"Yeah! We'll show them!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!"
"Uncle Jimbo"
"Is mistletoe offensive?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Is anyone offended by mistletoe?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Lose the mistletoe!"
"Stan"
"You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!"
"Cartman"
"How do you know?"
"Stan"
"'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night."
"Cartman"
"Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000."
"Stan"
"What's that?"
"Cartman"
"I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet."
"Kyle"
"Hello, everybodyyy."
"Stan"
"What's in the box, dude?"
"Kyle"
"It's a surprise."
"Cartman"
"Let me see!"
"Kyle"
"O-Okay. But don't scare him..."
"Stan"
"[angrily] Dude, sick!!!"
"Cartman"
"Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?"
"Kenny"
"(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)"
"Kyle"
"Wait! You guys! He's alive!"
"Stan"
"Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep."
"Kyle"
"Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!!"
"Researcher"
"Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready?"
"Researcher"
"Here we go: Christ"
"Researcher"
"Hm. Okay. Cherub."
"Researcher"
"Hm... Camel"
"Researcher"
"Hm. Sad."
"Researcher"
"Stupid Wop Dago."
"Researcher"
"Bench..."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?"
"Janitor 2"
"Mayor's orders."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus."
"Cartman"
"Thanks to Kyle's mother."
"Kyle"
"Shut up, Cartman!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Yes, Eric?"
"Cartman"
"How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor."
"Kyle"
"I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"
O-ho. WeeeeeeeeeellllKyle's mom is a bitch,
she's a big fat bitch,
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch,
if there ever was a bitch,
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.

"
"Kyle"
"Shut up, Cartman!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Howdy-ho!"
"Kyle"
"[hushed] Mr. Hankey."
"Cartman"
"
Monday she's a bitch,
on Tuesday she's a bitch,
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different,
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!

"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Golly, that isn't very nice."
"Mr. Hankey"
"I'd sure like to teach him a lesson."
"Cartman"
"
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom? 
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BIIIIII-I-I-ITCH - aahh.

"
"Kyle"
"Mr. Hankey, no!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"What the... "
"Cartman"
"Gross, Kyle!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric?"
"Kyle"
"Uuuuuuhh..."
"Cartman"
"YOU SICK BASTARD!"
"Mr. Mackey, Jr."
"Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?"
"Kyle"
"I don't have a problem."
"Mr. Mackey"
"Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia."
"Kyle"
"What's that?"
"Mr. Mackey"
"Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle."
"Kyle"
"Mookie-stinks?"
"Mr. Mackey"
"Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?"
"Kyle"
"Wull, not on purpose."
"Mr. Mackey"
"So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya?"
"Kyle"
"Well, sometimes..."
"Mr. Mackey"
"And that must make you mad."
"Kyle"
"Well sure."
"Mr. Mackey"
"Mad enough to kill, Kyle???"
"Kyle"
"No, dude!"
"Mr. Mackey"
"Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?"
"Kyle"
"But Mr. Hankey seemed so real..."
"Mr. Mackey"
"Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have."
"Mr. Hankey"
"Kyle!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Howdy-ho."
"Mr. Mackey"
"Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?"
"Mr. Hankey"
"
Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way...

"
"Mr. Mackey"
"To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac..."
"Mr. Mackey"
"Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy..."
"Students"
"Hhmm."
"Mr. Garrison"
"...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?"
"Mr. Garrison"
" Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous."
"Mr. Garrison"
" Okay. Now let's practice our..."
"Mr. Mackey"
"No! Get away from me!"
"Kyle"
"Here. Just look more closely at it."
"Mr. Mackey"
"No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?"
"Stan"
"Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please."
"Nurse"
"Reason?"
"Kyle"
"I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac."
"Nurse"
"Any allergies?"
"Kyle"
"No."
"Nurse"
"Jacket!"
"Cartman"
"Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on?"
"Artsy Man"
"Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down."
"His Date"
"Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great!"
"Sheila"
"Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it."
"Kyle"
"
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...

"
"MC"
"Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday..."
"Man 1"
"[pointing] Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage. That's very offensive to non-Christians."
"Uncle Jimbo"
"Oh, come on!"
"Man 1"
"Hey! Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!"
"Randy Marsh"
"I agree."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh brother."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there."
"Kenny"
"(Hunh?)"
"MC"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef."
"Chef"
"
I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights.

"
"Chef"
"
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
You can break my heart, and that means...

"
"Stan"
"I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him."
"Chef"
"
...We should make love,

"
"Cartman"
"Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it."
"Chef"
"
...'Cause if we don't-

"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Okay, kids, get ready to take your places."
"MC"
"Thank you, Chef!"
"Kenny"
"(Phew!)"
"MC"
"And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!"
"Voice-over"
"As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes."
"Voice-over"
"How like a turtle the sun looks."
"Sheila"
"What the hell is this???"
"Sheila"
"This is horrible!!!"
"Father Maxi"
"This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"You're the ones who made it this way!"
"Father Maxi"
"Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian."
"Gerald"
"It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!"
"Elderly Tree Hugger"
"All you bastards ruined Christmas!"
"Gerald"
"Get him in the ribs!"
"Father Maxi"
"Oof."
"Man in audience"
"Damn tree-hugger!"
"Stan"
"This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen."
"Wendy"
"Yeah."
"Chef"
"Say, where's Kyle?"
"Stan"
"We committed him."
"Chef"
"What? Why?"
"Cartman"
"'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went."
"Chef"
"Chirstmas poo? You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey."
"Stan"
"Huh?! O-oh."
"Stan"
"This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!"
"Chef"
"Well! You can believe in him now."
"Woman"
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH."
"Stan"
"I believe."
"Wendy"
"I believe in Mr. Hankey."
"Mr. Hankey"
"Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery."
"Cartman, Stan"
"Whoa!!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Howdy-ho, Chef!"
"Chef"
"Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!"
"Cartman"
"Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!"
"Cartman"
"Talking poo is where I draw the line!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"What's all the ruckus?"
"Chef"
"I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey. The whole town is about to kill each other."
"Mr. Hankey"
"I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"STOP FIGHTING!!"
"The Mayor"
"Oh my God, what the hell is that thing?"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, ""Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies""."
"Stan"
"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
"Kyle"
"
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...

"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!"
"Kyle"
"Oh no, I'm not sane yet!"
"Mr. Hankey"
"I brought some friends with me."
"Kyle"
"Friends?"
"Townsfolk"
"Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!"
"Kyle"
"You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy?"
"Townsfolk"
"
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo...

"
"Townsfolk"
"
...he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you...

"
"Townsfolk"
"
...Even if you're a Jew

"
"Mr. Pirrip"
"
Sometimes he's nutty, sometimes he's corny,
he can be brown or greenish-brown
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
he might come to your town

"
"Townsfolk"
"
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me. I love you
Heeeeeeee Looooooves Yoooooouu!

"
"Mr. Hankey"
"Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas."
"Cartman"
"Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!"
"Santa Claus"
"Howdy-ho ho ho!"
"Stan"
"You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too."
"Kyle"
"Yeah...[concerned] You know, it seems like something's still not right."
"Cartman"
"Yeah, something feels...unfinished."
"Stan"
"Wh-what could it be?"
"Kenny"
"(Yee he hee!)"
"Jesus"
"
Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...
