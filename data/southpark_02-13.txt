"Host"
"Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?"
"Tom and Mary"
"We're ready, Bob!"
"Bob"
"Any particular prize you're hoping for?"
"Mary"
"Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!"
"Tom"
"Oh, anywhere'd be great!"
"Bob"
"Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum?"
"Tom"
"Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this."
"Mary"
"The upper vascular hood."
"Bob"
"I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!"
"Bob"
"Fred tell 'em what they've won."
"Fred the Announcer"
"Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado!"
"Mary"
"Where?"
"Fred the Announcer"
"That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival."
"Fred the Announcer"
"Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!"
"Fred the Announcer"
"Congratulations, Tom and Mary."
"Bob"
"Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited."
"Tom"
"What was second prize again?"
"Bob"
"That's all for now. See you tomorrow on..."
"Bob and Audience"
"Ooo, What The Hell Is That!"
"Mary"
"Ah shit!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!"
"Jimbo"
"This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!"
"Jimbo"
"Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!"
"Mary"
"This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!"
"Tom"
"Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it."
"Mary"
"Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!"
"Toss-a-Ball Operator"
"Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes."
"Kyle"
"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls."
"Stan"
"Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy."
"Kyle"
"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs."
"Operator"
"Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada."
"Stan"
"Really?"
"Operator"
"Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves."
"Cartman"
"Wwow!"
"Kyle"
"Dude, that kicks ass!"
"Cartman"
"[Breathlessly.] Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?"
"Operator"
"Five dollars for three balls."
"Cartman"
"Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!"
"Operator"
"Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth."
"Cartman"
"That's easy!"
"Operator"
"Okay, we've got a player!"
"Cartman"
"Ay! Check it out!"
"Cartman"
"Damn it!"
"Operator"
"It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper."
"Cartman"
"Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!"
"Kyle"
"You suck, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"I'd like to see you do better!"
"Kyle"
"Give me that!"
"Kyle"
"Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!"
"Operator"
"It's gotta go through her mouth."
"Kyle"
"But ih-"
"Operator"
"Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars."
"Kyle"
"Here, give me some money, Cartman!"
"Kyle"
"Lend me money, fat boy!"
"Cartman"
"I only have three dollars left, asshole!"
"Kyle"
"Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom."
"Jimbo"
"[Still onstage.] Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!"
"Kyle"
"Mom, give me some money!"
"Sheila"
"Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!"
"Kyle"
"I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls."
"Sheila"
"Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!"
"Kyle"
"I will if you give me money!"
"Sheila"
"Okay, here!"
"Cartman"
"Sweet."
"Jimbo"
"Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows."
"Jimbo"
"With that said, let's rock and roll!"
"Jimbo"
"Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!"
"Jimbo"
"They're loose!"
"Cows"
"Mooooo?!"
"Ned"
"Ow."
"Jimbo"
"[Running by.] Yeehaw!"
"Kyle"
"Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw."
"Cartman"
"I only need one, dude. I only need one."
"Operator"
"Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts."
"Stan"
"What's that?"
"Operator"
"Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?"
"Cartman"
"How much is it?"
"Operator"
"Just three tickets, boys."
"Chamber of Farts Ride"
"Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?"
"Kyle"
"Is it like a- haunted house or something?"
"Operator"
"Sure. It's veery scary."
"Cartman"
"Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five."
"Kyle"
"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
"Cartman"
"Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over."
"Kyle"
"You'd better be right, dude."
"Cartman"
"I'm right!"
"Operator"
"Keep your hands inside at all times."
"Kyle"
"Okay."
"Chamber of Farts Ride"
"So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!"
"Cartman"
"Eh! God-damnit!"
"Stan"
"What the hell was that?"
"Chamber of Farts Ride"
"Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!"
"Operator"
"All right, boys. Ride's over."
"Kyle"
"That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!"
"Stan"
"Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!"
"Cartman"
"[As they step down.] I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!"
"Kyle"
"That was a waste of money, Cartman!"
"Operator"
"Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets."
"Kyle"
"We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game."
"Cartman"
"Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money."
"Cartman"
"Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!"
"Kyle"
"This ride better be good!"
"Stan"
"Yeah, this line is way too long!"
"Cartman"
"I think we're almost to the end."
"Kyle"
"We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!"
"Stan"
"Here we go."
"Kyle"
"Finally!"
"Line Ride Operator"
"Did ya enjoy the ride?"
"Stan"
"What ride?"
"Kyle"
"Yeah."
"Line Ride Operator"
"This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line."
"Kyle"
"Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!"
"Line Ride Operator"
"That's five tickets, thank you very much."
"Line Ride Operator"
"Come see us again soon."
"Stan"
"My ass we will!"
"Kyle"
"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!"
"Stan"
"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again."
"Photo Seller"
"Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?"
"Cartman"
"How much?"
"Photo Seller"
"Just three dollars."
"Cartman"
"Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet."
"Kyle"
"You dumbass, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"What? This is cool."
"Kyle"
"No, it's not cool!"
"Cartman"
"It is, too!"
"Operator"
"Can I help you boys."
"Stan"
"We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again."
"Operator"
"O-kay, five dollars for three balls."
"Kyle"
"How much do we have left, Cartman?"
"Kyle"
"How much do we have left, Cartman?!"
"Cartman"
"Aah, three dollars."
"Kyle"
"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math."
"Kyle"
"You son of a bitch! Aaargh!"
"Cartman"
"Ey! Seriously!"
"Kyle"
"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
"Cartman"
"Well, I'm sorry!"
"Kyle"
"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?"
"Cartman"
"[Thinks a moment.] Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!"
"Kenny"
"[Pulls some out.] (What? These?)"
"Stan"
"Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?"
"Operator"
"Sure, as long as they're good."
"Kyle"
"Give him your food stamps, Kenny!"
"Kenny"
"(Nuh uh.)"
"Kyle"
"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!"
"Kenny"
"(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)"
"Cartman"
"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!"
"Kyle"
"Okay. Here we go."
"Kyle"
"Hey! That was right on target."
"Operator"
"Sorry, kid. Try again."
"Kyle"
"That does it! Shenanigans!"
"Kyle"
"SHENANIGANS!"
"Operator"
"Uhwhat are you doing?"
"Kyle"
"I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!"
"Operator"
"Shenanigans?"
"Officer Barbrady"
"What's all the hoo-ha?"
"Kyle"
"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator."
"Officer Barbrady"
"Why?"
"Kyle"
"This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just."
"Officer Barbrady"
"What do you have to say, carnival operator?"
"Operator"
"Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son."
"Operator"
"Here you go."
"Operator"
"There, you see? We have a winner!"
"Kyle"
"It worked!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!"
"Stan"
"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby."
"Officer Barbrady"
"Barbrady!"
"Stan"
"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?"
"Officer Barbrady"
"You said Buttbaby."
"Cartman"
"Sweet."
"Operator"
"Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick."
"Kyle"
"No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there."
"Operator"
"Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those."
"Kyle"
"What?!"
"Operator"
"You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
"Kyle"
"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-"
"Operator"
"[Ignoring them, speaking to the crowd] Step on up, just five dollars to play!"
"Kyle"
"Damnit, I have to have those dolls!"
"Stan"
"This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win."
"Kyle"
"[Something stops him.] Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000."
"Kyle"
"Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!"
"Cartman"
"What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?"
"Kyle"
"[Grabbing Cartman by the collar.] Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open!"
"Cartman"
"O-kay, I'll get on the bull."
"Kyle"
"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!"
"Stan"
"[To Cartman.] He really wants those dolls."
"Cartman"
"I guess, damn!"
"Mary"
"That ride wasn't very good."
"Tom"
"Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time."
"Mary"
"You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time."
"Stan"
"Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman."
"Cartman"
"Hey, this is sweet."
"Kyle"
"You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?"
"Cartman"
"I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time."
"Stan"
"We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go."
"Cartman"
"Ye-gah!"
"Cartman"
"Ow!"
"Cartman"
"Son of a bitch!"
"Stan"
"How long was that?"
"Kyle"
"That wasn't quite ten seconds."
"Stan"
"Damn it!"
"Stan"
"That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that."
"Cartman"
"[Whispering.] You guys, eh seriously, my back!"
"Kyle"
"Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!"
"Cartman"
"[Whispering.] Seriously. Help."
"Cartman"
"Screw you guys. Hate you guys."
"Kyle"
"What'd you say, Cartman??"
"Cartman"
"[Whispering.] I hate you guys!"
"Kyle"
"I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull."
"Cartman"
"[Whispering.] Hate you guys."
"Rancher"
"Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got."
"Kyle"
"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull."
"Rancher"
"Well, have fun, boys."
"Kyle"
"Okay, Cartman. You ready?"
"Cartman"
"[Hesitantly.] Nnoo."
"Kyle"
"Open the gate!"
"Cartman"
"All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride."
"Kyle"
"[Whispers to Stan.] That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!"
"Cartman"
"Yeah, this is sweet!"
"Stan"
"What are you going to do?"
"Kyle"
"Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball."
"Stan"
"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea."
"Cartman"
"Eeyy!"
"Kyle"
"That's better."
"Stan"
"Hold on, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!"
"Cartman"
"Mother f-"
"Kyle"
"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!"
"Stan"
"Come on, Cartman."
"Kenny"
"(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)"
"Kyle"
"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!"
"Kyle"
"Get up!"
"Kyle"
"Get UP!"
"Stan"
"You okay, dude?"
"Stan"
"Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?"
"Kyle"
"Dude, I think we broke him."
"Dr. Doctor"
"Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma."
"Stan"
"What's the matter with him."
"Dr. Doctor"
"Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li."
"Kyle"
"..Oh."
"Stan"
"But can he still ride a bull?"
"Dr. Doctor"
"What?"
"Kyle"
"We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?"
"Dr. Doctor"
"No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep."
"Kyle"
"Damn it!"
"Stan"
"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?"
"Cartman"
"Bân xua, Lee bân xua!
(rough translation: Old friends, Lee old friends!)"
"Stan"
"What?!"
"Cartman"
"Boyongture taur lur mahrter."
"Stan"
"Oh, he's fine, dude."
"Kyle"
""
"Cartman"
"Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi."
"Stan"
"Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo."
"Jimbo"
"All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!"
"Jimbo"
"Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked."
"Jimbo"
"Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial!"
"Mary"
"Where are we going to put a 60-foot tall statue of a cow?"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists."
"Mary"
"Oh my God!"
"Stan"
"How's he doing?"
"Kyle"
"He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute."
"Cartman"
"Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har."
"Stan"
"Do you think he can ride the bull?"
"Kyle"
"Yeah, I think so."
"Stan"
"Cool."

"Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!"
"Soldier"
"Huh?"
"Cartman"
"Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time."
"Soldier"
"Go away, kid. You're grossing me out."
"Cartman"
"Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!"
"Soldier"
"Beat it, kid! Come on, honey."
"Chamber of Farts Operator"
"Come one, come all! The Chamber of Farts has been fixed and is reopen!"
"Stan"
"Jesus, dude!"
"Kyle"
"Hey, where's Cartman?"
"Stan"
"Oh, hell!"
"Kenny"
"(I don't know where he went!)"
"Stan"
"Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride."
"Kenny"
"(Okay.)"
"Tom"
"Hoh, it's so cold here."
"Mary"
"Where is that sheriff?! We need water!"
"Tom"
"Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary."
"Mary"
"You're right. We're not being positive. At least we get some time alone."
"Tom"
"Yeah, and at least we've got our health."
"Grey Hat"
"I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never seen nothin' like it."
"Mitchell"
"Where are they again?"
"Grey Hat"
"Just right up over this ridge."
"Grey Hat"
"That's what they've been doin' all morning, just sittin' there and mooin'. And more cows come all the time."
"Mitchell"
"Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing, when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult!"
"Grey Hat"
"[Ponders] Hmm. Cow cult."
"Announcer"
"The grand-daddy of 'em all, the South Park Cow Days Rodeo! Let's begin the bull-riding event. Grand prize: $5000!"
"Stan"
"Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!"
"Kenny"
"(I don't know, can't find him.)"
"Kyle"
"He's up in, like, twenty minutes!"
"Kenny"
"(I know, I know!)"
"Cartman"
"[Off-camera.] Hello, prease! Hello!"
"Stan"
"[Points to him.] There he is!"
"Cartman"
"Sucky-sucky, five dorrah."
"Grey Hat"
"Here they are, just like we told you."
"Jimbo"
"Okay, that's enough-a that! You cows need to dis-perse! All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!"
"Jimbo"
"All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!"
"Ned"
"Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies!"
"Ned"
"Bad cows stay! Stay!"
"Ned"
"AAAAAH!"
"Jimbo"
"Holy crow! Play dead, Ned!"
"Grey Hat"
"[Still on the ridge, casually.] I reckon we should get some help."
"Mitchell"
"I reckon."
"Kyle"
"Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake."
"Stan"
"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!"
"Cartman"
"Sucky-sucky five dollah."
"Announcer"
"Up first, No. 24, Jack McMack!"
"Announcer"
"Three, two, one."
"Jack"
"Yeehaw! Yehoo! Yeehaw!"
"Jack"
"Aaaaaaaa!"
"Announcer"
"Oooh, that's gonna cost him a point deduction. Up next, number 14, Ming Li!"
"Cartman"
"Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!"
"Announcer"
"Here we go!"
"Stan"
"Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this."
"Kyle"
"What do you mean?"
"Stan"
"I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull."
"Announcer"
"Let her go!"
"Cartman"
"Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!"
"Kyle"
"Hang on, Cartman!"
"Announcer"
"Wow, and this Vietnamese prostitute can really ride a bull!"
"Announcer"
"I guess she's had a lot of practice, if you know what I mean."
"Cartman"
"Aaah! Ten dorrah!"
"Cartman"
"Ten dollah, soldier boy!"
"Announcer"
"She's setting a new world record!"
"Crowd"
"Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li!"
"Cartman"
"Gaaah!"
"Cartman"
"Heeee!"
"Stan"
"Dude, that bull's gonna kill him."
"Kyle"
"Go help him, Kenny!"
"Kenny"
"(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!)"
"Stan"
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
"Kyle"
"You bastards!"
"Announcer"
"And this brave little whore from the East has really put on a show for us today!"
"Announcer"
"The winner of the bull-riding contest, Ming Li!"
"Cartman"
"Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar."
"Stan"
"We did it, dude, we did it!"
"Agent"
"Freeze, cows!"
"Agent"
"The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns!"
"Jimbo"
"You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!"
"Agent"
"You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer!"
"Agent"
"Move!"
"Jimbo"
"Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow!"
"Agent"
"Oh, dear Jesus, no!"
"Cow"
"Mooooo!"
"Jimbo"
"Nnoo!"
"Jimbo"
"They're killing themselves! Stop! Please! Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity!"
"Agent"
"This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months."
"Toss-A-Ball Operator"
"Oh, you boys are back again, huh?"
"Stan"
"Yeah. And we have $5000 this time."
"Kyle"
"How many ball does that get us?"
"Cartman"
"[Still Ming Li.] Odline daur shunba shunba?"
"Toss-A-Ball Operator"
"Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
"Kyle"
"You will?"
"Stan"
"Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?"
"Kyle"
"We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
"Cartman"
"Ten dollah? Sucky-sucky?"
"Kyle"
"What are we gonna do with them?"
"Stan"
"We should-"
"Kyle"
"..What the-?"
"Stan"
"Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!"
"Kyle"
"After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"What's all this?"
"Kyle"
"Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!"
"Father Maxi"
"Yeah, and the food is terrible!"
"Chamber of Farts Operator"
"Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo! What do you expect?"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?"
"Townspeople"
"Yeah!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?"
"Line Ride Operator"
"..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"You found it! You found the memorial!"
"Jimbo"
"Yeah."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"And the cows? Are they all back, too?"
"Jimbo"
"They're dead, mayor. They're all dead. [Sobs.]"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"What?!"
"Jimbo"
"Oho, it was awful! [Weeps.] Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing."
"Jimbo"
"[Still sad.] I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. God I need a cold beer and a burger."
"Jimbo"
"What's all the ruckus over there?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!"
"Jimbo"
"Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with- [Voice wavering.] Oooooh?"
"Jimbo"
"Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?"
"Officer Barbrady"
"[Nervously.] Yeah."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Didn't we ever release them?"
"Jimbo"
