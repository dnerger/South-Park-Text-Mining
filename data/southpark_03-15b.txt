Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah. [picks it up] This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:[begins to dance]I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play.

[Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.[holds up a book: ""The Night Before Christmas""]And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,[In India, next to a swami sitting on a bed of nails]Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. [gives beef to one man, pours eggnog on another]In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. [wraps a few people in Christmas lights]So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. [passes out wreaths]Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do.
