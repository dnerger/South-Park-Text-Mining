"[Downtown South Park. There's traffic and people on the sidewalk. Among all that is a small postman who looks pretty familiar. The postman stops at a kitchenware place and knocks on the door. A cashier comes to the door and opens it]

"
"What's this?
"
"An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
"
"Thanks.

"You can count on Postman Butters! [salutes and leaves. As he does so, the cashier makes a ball out of the flyer and tosses it away. Butters doesn't notice, but instead sees a woman coming up and hands her a flyer] Special delivery, ma'am. [sees a man coming up and hands him a flyer. The woman crumples up her flyer and tosses it away] Here you are, sir. [the man balls up and tosses his flyer away] Brand new sushi restaurant in town. [Butters sees another man and hands him a flyer] A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! [the man crumples up his flyer and tosses is away. Butters ends up in front of City Wok and enters. He approaches the counter]

"Welcome to Shitty Wok. Can I take a order prease?

"Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.

"[leaves the counter] Wha you talking 'bout?
"
"It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
"
"A what? Ret me see that! [grabs the flyer] Oh no, a sushi prace? How come every time a hard-working Chinese man open a business, some shmelly Japanese dog has to come and try invade him?!

"Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
"
"Where is this Japanese-uh toiret bowl?! How far from my Shitty Wok?!
"
"Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.

"[Inside City Sushi. Butters follows Mr. Kim in]

"What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!

"No I don't want Shitty tuna roll! I want you to go find another shitty town to open your Shitty Sushi prace!

"I am speaking Engrish! Why don't you speak a fucking Engrish, you soba eating fuck!

"Get out or I call porice!
"
"Come on, kid, you don't wanna eat this-a Shitty Sushi! It give you worms.

"[Butters' house, day. Sgt. Yates and another office bring Butters home. Sgt. Yates knocks, Mr. Stotch answers]

"Hello?
"
"Sir, does this mailman belong to you?
"
"That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?
"
"There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.
"
"What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
"
"But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-

"We'll send a bill for the damages, [the officers turn and leave] but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? [Stephen closes the door]
"
"[Butters' house, inside. Linda meets Stephen at the foot of the stairs as he has words with Butters]

"Go up to your room, now! [Butters goes upstairs]
"
"What's going on?
"
"Butters started an Asian turf war!
"
"Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
"
"I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.
"
"[Center for Criminally Insane Children. Inside, a doctor is in a lab with Butters as Linda and Stephen wait outside. The doctor opens the door and sighs. He meets with Butters' parents.]
"
"Well Dr. Janus?
"
"I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
"
"What?
"
"There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named ""Postman Butters"" and yet another is ""Fireman Butters."" And then there's even ""Inspector Butters"" and uh, ""Professor Chaos"".
"
"Oh my God!
"
"From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.
"
"Oh, poor Butters!
"
"Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?
"
"No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point. [glances at Butters] What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.

"[Dr. Janus' lab, day.]
"
"Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?
"
"Sure.
"
"What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
"
"Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
"
"You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
"
"Sure.
"
"I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
"
"Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
"
"Inspector Butters, what do you want?
"
"Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
"
"And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
"
"Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
"
"He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
"
"What? Why would I do that?
"
"Who am I speaking to now?
"
"Me, Butters.
"
"Ah, Butters. You're back.
"
"Sir, I'm confused.
"
"I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
"
"Really?
"
"Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.
"
"[a teenaged personality] Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.
"
"Pardon me?
"
"He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.
"
"Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.
"
"Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!
"
"Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?

"
"Yes!

"
"[a recording] This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
"
"Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.

"[a recording] Well goodnight for now. [leaves the desk and goes to bed] Goodnight, Butters.
"
"Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward. [fast-forwards three hours and then gasps. At normal speed, his bedroom door opens slowly. A second later, Dr. Janus enters] Dr. Janus? [nothing happens for three more hours, so Butters fast-forwards to 3:32 in the morning, when Dr. Janus unzips his pants, pulls out his dick and urinates all over Butters, puts his penis away, zips his pants up, and punches Butters HARD several times before running out of the bedroom.
