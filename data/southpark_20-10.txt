"NSA Agent"
"[From a nearby workstation.] Sir, someone is leading a coordinated cyber strike on the TrollTrace website."
"Mr. Garrison"
"[Joyously.] A cyber attack, well that's good! Where's it comin' from?"
"NSA Agent"
"It could be Russian, we don't know. Whoever this troll is, he's pretty fucking hardcore sir."

"Okay, okay, Token? Token are you there?"
"Token"
"I'm here, what's this about Kyle?"

"I can't tell you dude, I just need your

"Alright, 
I'm not jokin', yeah

 I need you to tell me the worst thing I can say on the United Negro College Fund website to piss off black people."
"Token"
"What!?"

"That helps thank you."
"Kyle"
"Tweek, Craig, I need you to get on the GLAAD website and respond to all the horrible shit I just said about gay people."
"Craig"
"Why'd you say horrible shit about gay people?"
"Kyle"
"It's not important, just get on it and respond."
"Kyle"
"[To Tweek & Craig.] Hang on. [To Stan.] Stan! Finally. Dude I need everybody online now!"
"Stan"
"For what?"
"Kyle"
"Dude, there's no time to explain, you gotta go out and get everybody, tell them to get on their computers, go!"
"Stan"
"[Pumped up] Okay!"

"Jimmy, what's the worst possible thing you could say on a website for handicapped Syrian refugees?"

"Gerald"
"Yes! Yes, where are you?"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers."
"Gerald"
"How long before the website goes online?"
"Danish Worker"
"Less than ten mienutes."
"Gerald"
"Oh God!"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate."
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"Skank, whoever's doing it is doing it from your account."
"Gerald"
"My account?"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people."

"This is amazing! And it's all thanks to you little girl, how did you get to be so smart?"

"Yep."
"Cartman"
"We have to tell someone the truth, Butters."
"Butters"
"Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars."
"Cartman"
"It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before."
"Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker"
"Hey, you guys need anything? Water, Soda?"
"Cartman"
"Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?"

"Kyle, I wanna help tooo."
"Kyle"
"No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say."
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins."
"Kyle"
"Who are you?"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you."
"Kyle"
"O-- Okay?"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too."
"Kyle"
"What the hell is ""Trevor's Axiom""?"
"NSA Agent"
"Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling."
"NSA Agent"
"It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C."
"NSA Agent"
"Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected."
"NSA Agent"
"Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers..."
"General Revaur"
"[Interrupting] It could blow up the Internet before TrollTrace ever does substantial damage."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll."
"Cartman"
"Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars."
"Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker"
"You keep saying that, but not why."
"Butters"
"Because Eric knows the future."
"Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker"
"What are you talking about?"
"Cartman"
"I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her."
"Cartman"
"But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars."
"Cartman (Voiceover)"
"At first, you'll be super-happy, bouncing around the red sand."
"Cartman"
"Everyone will be really nice."
"Female 1"
"Hi!"
"Female 2"
"Hi!"
"Cartman"
"Hi!"
"Cartman"
"You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool."
"Cartman"
"But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women."
"Cartman"
"Hmm, let's see"
"Cartman"
"And then you'll start to wonder, ""Where are all the other guys?"""
"Butters"
"[Whispering] Look underground."
"Cartman"
"And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for."
"Cartman"
"What is this place?"
"Cartman"
"And that's when you'll learn the truth..."
"Cartman"
"Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women."
"Cartman"
"They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes."
"Cartman"
"What?! No, no!"
"Cartman"
"You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!"
"Cartman"
"Nooooooo! No, no!"
"Female 3"
"Write jokes!"
"Cartman"
"No! No!"
"Cartman"
"And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars."
"Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker"
"That's, That's ridiculous. Why would women need us to do that? They're just as funny as men."
"Cartman"
"If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on."
"Female SpaceX Employee"
"What?"
"Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker"
"What?"
"Cartman"
"You have to help us stop this!"
"Gerald"
"[Frustrated.] Ah! God damn it!"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"Skank! You still there?"
"Gerald"
"[He walks over to the TV.] Yeah, I'm here."
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers."
"Gerald"
"[He looks up at the monito.r] I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room."
"TrollTrace employee"
"Oh, the key code to the conference room is 9..."
"Gerald"
"[He runs over to the panel and presses 9.] Yeah...?"
"TrollTrace employee"
"That's it. 9."
"Gerald"
"[Frustrated.] Oh, for fuck's sake! [The panel light turns green, the door opens, and Gerald runs out.]"
"Sheila"
"[She's pounding the door.] Kyle! You better run if I get out of here! You better pray that--[The chair moves and she is begins to pry open the door with her hands.]-ah! "
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank. Skankhunt, are you there yet?"
"Gerald"
"Yeah, I'm up with all the servers."
"TrollTrace employee"
"The first breaker should be there. Tell him to look for a large red lever."
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, do you see a large red lever?"
"Gerald"
"[notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever]"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Flip it off"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"[He speaks over P.A. system.] That's good. Keep going Skankhunt."
"Ike"
"You are all dumbass fuckwads."
"Ike"
"Lick my asshole, you Mexican bitch."
"Sheila"
"Ike!"
"Ike"
"Aah!"
"Sheila"
"[Yelling.] You dare lock me in the pantry, so you can play on your computer?!"
"Ike"
"Mommy!"
"Sheila"
"[Yelling.] You're gonna pay for what you've done!"
"Ike"
"Aah! [He runs out into the hallway.]"
"Ike"
"Kyle!"
"Sheila"
"Ike!"
"Kyle"
"[He throws down headset.] Shit!"
"Ike"
"Mommy got out!"
"Sheila"
"[Panting.] You...! You helped turned your brother this way!"
"Kyle"
"Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help--"
"Sheila"
"Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!"
"Kyle"
"Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent"
"Sheila"
"[Yelling.] Do you think I'm stupid?!"
"Kyle"
"No, Mom. You just don't know everything. [Kyle straps a vest around his chest.]"
"Sheila"
"You both march out of here, right now!"
"Kyle"
"I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family"
"Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker"
"Look, Elon, I'm just saying before we go any further, you might want to hear this kid out. [They both stop in front of Cartman and Butters.]"
"Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker"
"Go on, tell Elon."
"Cartman"
"Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground."
"Elon Musk"
"For what?"
"Cartman"
"What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor."
"Elon Musk"
"That's two things."
"Cartman"
"They're pretty related."
"Elon Musk"
"Women don't need us for comedy. They can be just as funny as men. You should meet my girlfriend. She's really smart and really funny."
"Cartman"
"Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon."
"Butters"
"I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it."
"Cartman"
"It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon."
"Cartman"
"They can live without us. We can't live without them."
"Cartman"
"If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon--[He turns around and notices that Elon isn't there.] Elon?"
"Kyle"
"Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care."
"Ike"
"You fat hooker."
"Kyle"
"You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out."
"Ike"
"You clean your fucking mouth out."
"Kyle"
"Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now!"
"Stan"
"Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town."
"Kyle"
"Shit!"
"Kyle"
"Hold on..."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Kyle?!"
"Kyle"
"[Surprised.] Oh, hey, Mr. President"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?!"
"Kyle"
"Uh...what do you mean?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you."
"Kyle"
"[Surprised.] It is?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Keep up the good work. We're gonna take that big shitstorm of hate you're creating and amplify it. We'll try to create enough energy to blow up the whole fucking internet. [He gives Kyle a military salute] You're doing God's work, son. Keep it up."
"Kyle"
"[He gives Mr. Garrison a half-hearted military salute.] Thanks?"
"Bedrager"
"Oh, no, you don't."
"Sheila"
"Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me."
"Sheila"
"What? What? What?"
"Laura"
"[She wipes her nose with a tissue.] The son of a bitch. He's such a bastard."
"Laura"
"When you marry someone and you think you know them..."
"Sheila"
"I don't know what you're talking about."
"Laura"
"TrollTrace. Its up and running. [She points to the laptop sitting on the table.]"
"Laura"
"It can tell you anybody's Internet history. [She starts to walk to her couch.]"
"Laura"
"I couldn't resist. I looked up my husband. [Sheila approaches the laptop.] The websites he's visited are just...disgusting!"
"Sheila"
"May I use this a moment?"
"Laura"
"Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see."
"Cartman"
"What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars."
"Butters"
"Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy."
"Cartman"
"If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat."
"Butters"
"What?!"
"Kyle"
"Butters! Where the fuck are you?!"
"Butters"
"Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you?"
"Kyle"
"SpaceX? Why?!"
"Butters"
"Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it."
"Kyle"
"[He swivels his chair around.] Like...how ginormic of an energy source?"
"Butters"
"Like enough to get humanity to Mars."
"Cartman"
"[He is heard over Kyle's phone.] Is that Kyle?"
"Cartman"
"[He takes Butters' phone.] Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now."
"Kyle"
"Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other."
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, there's no more time! Have you found the last breaker?"
"Gerald"
"I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway."
"TrollTrace employee"
"That last breaker should be there"
"Gerald"
"Heading to it now!"
"Bedrager"
"I'm ten steps ahead of you!"
"Bedrager"
"What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh?"
"Gerald"
"Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong!"
"Bedrager"
"What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to?"
"Gerald"
"It's completely heartless and malicious!"
"Bedrager"
"You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious?"
"Gerald"
"No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical."
"Bedrager"
"How is not satirical?"
"Sheila"
"There's nothing here."
"Sheila"
"Maybe Kyle was telling the truth. [She gets off of chair and walks towards Laura.]"
"Sheila"
"Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me."
"Laura"
"About what?"
"Sheila"
"I accused Ike of...of...well, I can't really say, but this thing says that he's clean. I got to find my boys, Laura. Thank you so much. [She approaches the front door.]"
"Laura"
"Its not our kids we have to be worried about. [Sheila stops and turns to her.]"
"Laura"
"My husband was on three ""married-but-dating"" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends?"
"Sheila"
"No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy."
"Laura"
"Sure, yeah. Respect. Nice of you to give him that. [She walks toward the laptop.]"
"Laura"
"Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?"
"NSA Agent"
"There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can."
"Army General 2"
" Mr. President, TrollTrace has been online for almost 15 minutes now. Its too late. We need to get you down to the bunker."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good."
"Soldier"
"[He holds the red telephone.] Mr. President, we have an urgent call from Kyle."
"Mr. Garrison"
"[He picks up the phone.] Sorry, Kyle. Looks like its not going to work."
"Kyle"
"[He types on his computer.] Mr. Garrison, I might have just found a lot more energy. Is there anyway the Pentagon can connect to SpaceX?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"SpaceX? What the fuck is that?"
"Kyle"
"[He types on his computer.] You know, the company trying to find new forms of energy, create jobs and get mankind to Mars."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Okay, that's dumb, but go on."
"Gerald"
"Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?"
"Bedrager"
"That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter."
"Gerald"
"No, but see, that's just nihilism."
"Bedrager"
"Oh, come on!"
"Gerald"
"That is!"
"Bedrager"
"So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous!"
"Gerald"
"You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other."
"Bedrager"
"So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire."
"Cartman"
"Attention all SpaceX employees. [Elon Musk and his group turn away from the energy source chamber and look up.]"
"Cartman"
"Please evacuate the building immediately. [A group of men working on Tesla cars stop and hear the announcement.]"
"Cartman"
"We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. [Heidi walks over to Cartman from behind.]"
"Cartman"
"The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can. [He notices Heidi.] Ah! [He puts the microphone away.] Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up?"
"Heidi"
"There's a bomb threat?"
"Cartman"
"Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. [He grabs Heidi and runs with her to the energy source chamber before she stops him.]"
"Heidi"
"Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately."
"Cartman"
"Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry."
"Heidi"
"Did I do something wrong?"
"Cartman"
"[He grabs Heidi's hands.] No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? [He then turns her away, so she doesn't see what's going on with the chamber.]"
"Heidi"
"You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh?"
"Cartman"
"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on."
"Heidi"
"Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings."
"Cartman"
"Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. [He puts his arm around her while looking back at the guys.]"
"Cartman"
"Now come on we got to get outside."
"Sheila"
"I shouldn't do this."
"Gerald"
"I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true. [He turns around.]"
"Gerald"
"All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people. [Bedrager looks down, agreeing with Gerald.]"
"Gerald"
"I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have. [He slowly shuffles forward towards Bedrager.]"
"Gerald"
"I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself. [He stops a few inches from Bedrager.] With only one minor difference."
"Bedrager"
"Noooooo!!!"
"Gerald"
"Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!"
"Dildo Shwaggins"
"That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!"
"Kyle"
"Mr. President, do it!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Reroute the internet through SpaceX!."
"Pentagon Employee"
"Rerouting now!"
"Sheila"
"[She stares at the black screen.] What the hell just happened?!"
"Cartman"
"Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?."
"Cartman"
"Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?"
"Heidi"
"Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh?"
"Cartman"
"Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares."
"Heidi"
"Well, what do you mean?"
"Cartman"
"It was a joke."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"And so, life goes on."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"The end of civilization didn't happen."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"A massive electrical pulse completely erased the internet."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"We've been given a second chance."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"A mulligan."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"Anything we might be ashamed of, gone forever."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"Maybe now boys and girls can learn to respect each other again."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"Realize how careful our online lives have to be."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"Because we've all seen what happens when the Twitters, Facebook and trolls decide our reality."
"Kyle (voiceover)"
"Now that we've been given this second chance, it is up to all of us to see what we do with it."
"News Anchor"
"And the first new e-mail since the internet was erased was successfully went out at 6 a.m. today. The honor went to a Mr. Dave Beckett of Boca Raton, Florida."
"News Reporter"
"Mr. Beckett, you had the honor of being the first person to socialize on the new internet. Could you tell us what you did?"
"Dave Beckett"
"Well, I sent an e-mail with a photo to my old friend, Thomas Winger, up in Connecticut."
"News Reporter"
"And what you did say to Mr. Winger?"
"Dave Beckett"
"[He pauses.] I showed him my dick, called him a fag."
