"
"It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
[leaves the menorah and stops by Ike's room, and looks in]
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.

[Ike is watching ""Call of Duty"" on his computer]

"[his commenter window pops up on screen] Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
"
"Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.

Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.

[he walks through the living room, then stops and looks around]
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,

[he looks at the TV and walks up to it]
What brought families together most was a good old TV

[he walks through the park with his head down]
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.

And if you try to complain, you get called a-

"Hmmm, it's kind of gay.

"Really??

"I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
"
"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome.""

"Well, gay is wholesome.

"
"We?
"
"I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend. [notices how dusty the TV is and wipes some of the dust off with his right hand] It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now.
"
"Wow. [smiles] Well that's awesome!
"
"Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
"
"M-Ah, I'd love to.
"
"Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!
"
"Uh okay! No problem! [Bill lets himself out]
"
"This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son!

"[Park County Police Station. Detective Harries is grilling Randy and Sharon on their story.]
"
"Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?
"
"Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
"
"[with mustache] Who's the famous artist?
"
"Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
"
"You're Lorde.
"
"The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.
"
"You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
"
"No! That was a copy of me!

"Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh! [bemused smile which quickly fades.]

"Yes!

"Did you shoot him?

"So what's the problem?
"
"He... appears to be just a hologram, sir.

"Who did?

"These producers making a big holiday special! [goes to the TV and wipes it clean] They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!

"That's a little strange, isn't it?
"
"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
"
"[The commercial begins]

"
"That son of a bitch!

"
"So far the holiday special is trending fine, but it appears that the Michael Jackson hologram is the most heavily tweeted.
"
"And we still have no idea where the damned hologram is?
"
"Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down.
"
"Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
"
"We got one shot at this, people! This [pounds his fist on the table] has to be the holiday special to end all holiday specials!
"
"Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??
"
"He's got his finger on the pulse of young America.
"
"Sir, I'm pretty sure that [reads from his phone] ""Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special"" is not a good name.
"
"No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
"
"[leans in] If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power!
"
"I can hear you, douchebag.
"
"People, you know what we're trying to do here. [leaves his desk and paces the room] We're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. That means being hip, being now.
"
"These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
"
"There, you see that? ""Blumpkin catchers."" Do any of you even know what that means? This kid is our way to connect with the youth of America, and I'm gonna give him all the power he needs.

"
"I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown.

"That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
"
"Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde.
"
"Who? Lorde? You're not Lorde, that's ignorant.
"
"Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?

"They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant! It's gonna be the most ignorant holiday special ever!
"
"A holiday special. Oh my God.

"It's directed at children! We have to stop them!
"
"Huh how about we say he's mixed race?
"
"As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay.
"
"[to Sharon] I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special! [to MJ's hologram] Can you help me stop them?!

"Because you just said, ""here in my room""!

"
"Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
"
"Why does that matter?
"
"Because Lorde is my dad, alright?! [walks forward as his anger drains away] Lorde is my dad.
"
"What?
"
"What are you talking about, Stan?
"
"He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.

"
"I guess... one step at a time.

"[Shelly's room, moments later. Randy knocks on her door, then looks in. Shelly is looking at her monitor]
"
"Shelly? Um, I'm Lorde. [she sits up a little] All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa.

"
"It was five years ago that I... became a grandpa. At first it was wonderful. I wanted to show my grandson everything. Teach him all about the entertainment business. One day I aasked him, ""Who's your favorite celebrity?"" You know what he said to me? He said, ""PeewwDiePie."" I had no idea who [turns around] he was talking about. So I looked it up. And he was this insignificant little game blogger from Sweden who my grandson thought was a god! No matter who else I tried to impress him with, he would just say, ""Meh."" To me! MEH! [turns back to the bar] What the hell is wrong with these kids today?? With this special, we will assimilate this generation's culture into ours!

"
"[walks ever closer to the camera] You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! [the signal is now disrupted]
"
"Hey! What's going on? What is that? [amid some special effects of snow and holly popping out of the upper right corner of screens everywhere, PewDiePie's commenter window appears]
"
"How's it goin' bros? This is [goes fullscreen]PewDiePie!
"
"What the hell?!
"
"PewDiePie!
"
"PewDiePie?!
"
"Thanks for all the shoutouts. I guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out.
"
"Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
"
"[mocking Cartman] God damn it, get out of here!
"
"Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
"
"This show is getting kind of boring, bros. What do you say we change it out to something more exciting?
"
"Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
"
"I know! Let's play Call of Duty! [the game pops up fullscreen and the commenter windows switch places]
"
"No! You can't do this!
"
"Ohhh yeah! This is more like it, bros!
"
"God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
"
"Okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. Let's get rid of him!
"
"NOOOO! [his commenter window disappears, as well as the holiday special]
"
"Oh yeah! Way better, bros! This is how we do it in Sweden! BOOM head shot! BOOM head shot!

"[South Park, next morning. At Stark's Pond, Stan and Kyle sit on a bench and look out over the lake.]
"
"Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
"
"I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
"
"Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
"
"Yeah.
"
"No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here. [notices PewDiePie's commenter window pop up to his right and above] And I, think that's great.
"
"Yeah, I think that's great too.
"
"Alright bros, it look like we'll have to end it there. I wanna thank South Park for being in my show. I hope you bros enjoyed watching, and as always, stay awesome!
"
"[End of #HappyHolograms.]
"
"[over the end credits] Oh! That's it bros. Show's over.
