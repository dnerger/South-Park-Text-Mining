"Mr. Garrison"
"Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"The prank is over!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch."
"Mr. Garrison"
"God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!"
"Kids"
"Yea--"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!"
"Kids"
"Awww..!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Okay. I'm going to turn around now."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Shit!"
"Pip"
"Where did everybody go?"
"Kids"
"Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!"
"Mother"
"Oh golly, Kevin, honey."
"Father"
"Good to see you again, son."
"Man"
"Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready."
"Pip"
"Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!"
"Stan"
"Shut up, Pip."
"Pip"
"Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?"
"Kyle"
"What do you mean?"
"Pip"
"Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead."
"Cartman"
"Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!"
"Stan"
"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks."
"Kyle"
"I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year."
"Stan"
"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt."
"Kyle"
"Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat."
"Cartman"
"Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!"
"Stan"
"Jesus, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"[Mumbles.] Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na."
"Stu"
"Hi, fellas."
"Boys"
"Hi, Stu."
"Stu"
"What can I do for you?"
"Kyle"
"We wanna buy M-80s."
"Stan"
"The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass."
"Cartman"
"Okay, that's it!"
"Cartman"
"Screw you guys! I'm going home."
"Kyle"
"What a baby."
"Stan"
"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please."
"Stu"
"I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?"
"Stan"
"Heard what?"
"Stu"
"All fireworks have been banned in Colorado."
"Kyle"
"What do ya mean?"
"Stu"
"It was in the paper this morning."
"Kyle"
"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?"
"Stu"
"Right."
"Stan"
"How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?"
"Kyle"
"Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives."
"Stan"
"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!"
"Kyle"
"Oo bastards!"
"Stan"
"A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass."
"Kyle"
"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?"
"Stu"
"I can still sell snakes."
"Stan/Kyle/ Kenny"
"Awww..!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake. [Listens.] I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call. [Switch.] Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems! [Switch.] Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smart-ass, I was being ironic..! [Hangs up.]"
"Officer Barbrady"
"[Emerging from under her desk.] I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Well, keep looking. [Pushes him down.]"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Oh?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?"
"Officer Barbrady"
"[From under the desk.] Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa-- [Swoons.] Oooooogh..."
"Officer Barbrady"
"I found him."
"Stan"
"Man, it's hot out here."
"Cartman"
"What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!"
"Kyle"
"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks."
"Stan"
"I know! Let's go sledding!"
"Kyle"
"Yeah!"
"Stan"
"Come on, Cartman, get on."
"Cartman"
"Stan?"
"Kyle"
"Let's go, dude. We're ready."
"Stan"
"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?"
"Cartman"
"Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?"
"Kyle"
"Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!"
"Cartman"
"Ugh... Whatever."
"Stan"
"What the hell is going on?"
"Jimbo"
"Hey there, boys!"
"Stan"
"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
"Jimbo"
"How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer."
"Kyle"
"Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands."
"Jimbo"
"What?!"
"Stan"
"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year."
"Jimbo"
"Oh my God! [Revs up.] Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case. [Drives off.] Buckle your seat belt, Ned."
"Ned"
"Mmmm-where are we going?"
"Jimbo"
"México, my amigo."
"Ned"
"Mmmm-why are we going to México?"
"Jimbo"
"To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?"
"Ned"
"Are fireworks legal in Mexico?"
"Jimbo"
"Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way."
"Charlie"
"At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!"
"Charlie"
"Oh, o-kay. [To himself.] Let's see..."
"Charlie"
"Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Ooooh!"
"Charlie"
"We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"[Writes notes.] Comanche helicopters..."
"Charlie"
"[Flips page.] Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time..."
"Charlie"
"Once lit, the snake will grow."
"Charlie"
"And good times will be had by all."
"Aide 1"
"Wonderful."
"Aide 2"
"Spectacular."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!"
"Aide 1"
"Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!"
"Aide 2"
"Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!"
"Kyle"
"[Singing.]
Dusty the dirtball...

"
"Stan"
"Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?"
"Kyle"
"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Hello, children. How is your summer going?"
"Stan"
"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison."
"Kyle"
"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat."
"Stan"
"That's good."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Mr. Hat is just a puppet."
"Kyle"
"Yup."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Mr. Hat isn't real."
"Stan"
"Right."
"Cartman"
"Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?"
"Stan"
"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard."
"Cartman"
"It is not!"
"Stan"
"Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool."
"Kyle"
"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee."
"Cartman"
"I am not swimming around in pee!"
"Stan"
"Whatever, dude."
"Cartman"
"My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday."
"Kyle"
"[Grins with Stan.] Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics."
"Cartman"
"I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home."
"Stan"
"But Cartman, we're trying to--"
"Cartman"
"Uh, screw you guys. Home. [Leaves.]"
"Stan"
"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?"
"Kyle"
"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always."
"Stan"
"There, how does that look?"
"Kyle"
"Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it."
"Stan"
"Uh, crap..!"
"Cartman"
"Eh-eh-eh-eh..."
"Instructor"
"Okay kids, everyone in the pool!"
"instructor"
"Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now."
"Cartman"
"Nuh-uh."
"Instructor"
"Just jump in."
"Cartman"
"I don't wanna."
"Instructor"
"It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it."
"Cartman"
"Egh--"
"Instructor"
"There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us."
"Cartman"
"Huh? First graders?"
"Cartman"
"Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!"
"Aide 2"
"I'm sure it'll be here any second."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Shut up!"
"Aide 2"
"Copy that."
"Conductor"
"Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?"
"Stan"
"He's taking swimming lessons."
"Conductor"
"Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And..."
"Conductor"
"Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Wait a minute... It's the snake!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!"
"Jimbo"
"Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr."
"Proprietor"
"¿Qué?"
"Jimbo"
"Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr."
"Proprietor"
"¿Necesita usted un cohete grande?"
"Ned"
"Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr."
"Jimbo"
"Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone."
"Ned"
"Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr."
"Jimbo"
"Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July."
"Jimbo"
"We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning."
"Ned"
"Hmmm-bueyno."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Hello?"
"Caller (Mr. Mackey)"
"Hello, is Mr. Hat there?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Is this some kind of joke?"
"Caller (Mr. Mackey)"
"[snickers] Yes."
"Mr. Garrison"
"You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!"
"Caller (Mr. Mackey)"
"I don't think you can, m'kay."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Goddammit..!"
"Shari Lewis"
"So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?"
"Lamb Chop"
"Well, I'd like to sing you a song."
"Shari"
"Hey, let's sing one to-gether!"
"Lamb Chop"
"
As long as we're together,
we can do anything
We can take on the whole darn world
We're happy as clams,
with plenty of pearls
Through thick and thin,
we've always been to-geth-er...

"
"Shari"
"Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!"
"Shari"
"No! Lamb Chop, no!"
"Lamb Chop"
"Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!"
"Instructor"
"Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later."
"Cartman"
"Later's fine."
"Instructor"
"Just do your side stroke."
"Cartman"
"I only know how to do it doggie style."
"Instructor"
"That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!"
"Cartman"
"Can I do it doggie style?"
"Instructor"
"Okay."
"Instructor"
"That's it! That's it, you can do it!"
"Cartman"
"Sweet..!"
"Cartman"
"Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!"
"Instructor"
"Come on, Eric!"
"Cartman"
"No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home."
"Anchor"
"Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name."
"Creamy Goodness"
"Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history."
"Creamy Goodness"
"Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us."
"Creamy Goodness"
"Alrighty then, looks like we're ready."
"Stan"
"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?"
"Cartman"
"Fine."
"Kyle"
"I heard you won't even get in the deep end."
"Cartman"
"Well, you heard wrong, hippie!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!"
"Conductor"
"This is it. And a-one and a-two and a..."
"Audience"
"Ooohhhh..!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"What is fuck is that?!"
"Aide 2"
"I think it's The Stars and Stripes."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Oh, hell. Light the snake!"
"Audience"
"Ooooooh!"
"Audience"
"Ahhhhh!"
"Jimbo:"
"Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking."
"Jimbo"
"I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
"Guard"
"Good evening, gentlemen."
"Jimbo"
"Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland."
"Guard"
"Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions."
"Jimbo"
"Fire away, we have nothing to hide."
"Guard"
"Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?"
"Jimbo"
"No, sir."
"Guard"
"Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?"
"Jimbo"
"Yes. [Ned recoils.] I mean, no! No!"
"Guard"
"Open your trunk, please, sir."
"Jimbo"
"Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?"
"Charlie"
"Die out?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Yes, you know, expire, end."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?"
"Charlie"
"Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big."
"Charlie"
"I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"What?!"
"Kyle"
"[Looking up.] Dude! That thing is huge!"
"Stan"
"Yeah, they need to shut it off."
"Cartman"
"[Distracted.] Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!"
"Man 1"
"Somebody stop it!"
"Man 2"
"It's out of control!"
"Stan/Kyle/ Cartman"
"Aarrgghh!!"
"Kyle"
"Kenny! Watch out!"
"Kenny"
"(Waarrggh!!)"
"Kenny"
"(Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!)"
"Stan"
"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
"Kyle"
"You bastard!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"[Horrified.] Oh my God! [Grabs Charlie.] You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!"
"Charlie"
"Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes... [Mutters indistinctly.]"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"So when does it run out?!"
"Charlie"
"November. Of next year."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Oh, hell..!"
"Creamy Goodness"
"Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work."
"Tom"
"Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future."
"Stan"
"Man, this sucks."
"Kyle"
"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!"
"Stan"
"We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help."
"Cartman"
"Where is Chef?"
"Chef"
"[Slowly.]
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-ee
And all that I want to be-ee-ee is...[Quickly.]
You and me
And her; simultaneous
You and me, and you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three; simultaneous
Ooh, that's right...


[The phone rings and Chef answers it.]
Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what?... A giant snake?... Killing everybody?!... Growing bigger?!... Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, fudge ya.
[He hangs up and resumes singing.]


Simultaneous, you and me
And you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three...

"
"Kyle"
"What'd he say?"
"Stan"
"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves."
"Cartman"
"Wow."
"Kyle"
"How is that gonna help?"
"Anchor"
"All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen."
"Preacher"
"Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you."
"Assistant"
"From this day on, all will be well."
"New Mormon"
"I already feel like things are getting better."
"Mr. Garrison"
"And I can't sleep or think..."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?"
"Dr. Katz"
"Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?"
"Dr. Katz"
"Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah."
"Mr. Garrison"
"At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning."
"Dr. Katz"
"Um... Ahem..."
"Dr. Katz"
"Are you gay?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"What?!"
"Dr. Katz"
"[Stammers.] It-it's j-just-- It's just a question."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Are you propositioning me?"
"Dr. Katz"
"No."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!"
"Dr. Katz"
"Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Mr. Hat, on the other hand..."
"Dr. Katz"
"Mr. Hat was gay?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations."
"Dr. Katz"
"I see."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing."
"Dr. Katz"
"That I did not need to know."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Well, I'm just sayin'."
"Mr. Katz"
"Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet."
"Dr. Katz"
"What do you think about that?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"I think you're the loony one in this room."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo."
"Jimbo"
"Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again."
"Ned"
"Mmmmmmm-yup."
"Jimbo"
"Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light."
"Ned"
"Mmm-well better luck next year."
"Jimbo"
"Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again."
"Ned"
"[Reads cue card.] Mmmm-is anyone other than the two of you riding in this vehicle?"
"Jimbo"
"No."
"Ned"
"Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?"
"Jimbo"
"[Hesitantly.] Yes?"
"Jimbo"
"Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?"
"Jimbo"
"Holy smokes! What the hell is that?"
"Ned"
"Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife!"
"Jimbo"
"Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!"
"Brett Favre"
"Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before."
"Reporter"
"As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000..."
"Reporter"
"...people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers."
"Reporter"
"...And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now."
"Aide 1"
"Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is... sick."
"Reporter 2"
"""Sick""?! What kind of lame excuse is that?"
"Print Reporter"
"You gotta be kidding me!"
"Reporter 3"
"Oh, this is ridiculous!"
"Reporter 4"
"Come on, we want answers."
"Aide 2"
"Sh-she's having her period."
"Reporter 4"
"[Softly.] Oh."
"Aide 1"
"We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out."
"Aide 2"
"""We're sorry. Our bad."""
"Aide 1"
"Thank you, that is all."
"Cartman"
"Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end."
"Cartman"
"Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it."
"Stan"
"How many days left in summer?"
"Kyle"
"A lot, I think."
"Stan"
"Dammit! I just want it to snow again!"
"Kyle"
"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon."
"Jimbo"
"Buenos gracias, boys."
"Stan"
"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
"Jimbo"
"Oh, now, why the long faces?"
"Kyle"
"We're bored."
"Stan"
"There's nothin' to do."
"Jimbo"
"Well, I don't think those are problems..."
"Jimbo"
"...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!"
"Stan/Kyle"
"Hooray!"
"Jimbo"
"Careful with those, now, those are dangerous."
"Jimbo"
"Point 'em away from your eyes, now."
"Kyle"
"Wow! These are huge!"
"Jimbo"
"Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child."
"Stan"
"Hey, look! We blew up the snake!"
"Citizen"
"All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out."
"Jimbo"
"Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!"
"Stan/Kyle"
"Hooray!"
"Cartman"
"I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end."
"Cartman"
"I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!"
"Instructor"
"[Off-screen.] The snake's been destroyed. [Removes notice.] The pool's open!"
"Cartman"
"Huh? "
"Cartman"
"Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!"
"Citizen 2"
"Look! They put out the snake!"
"Mayor McDaniels"
"Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly."
"Kyle"
"Hey, look! It's snowing!"
"Jimbo"
"Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell."
"Stan"
"Winter's back!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Wow, it's a black blizzard!"
"Kyle"
"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig."
"Mr. Twig"
"That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall."
"Stan"
"Well, I can hardly wait."
"Chef"
"Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..?"
"Stan"
"Hey, Chef!"
"Cartman"
"How's it going?"
"Man"
"Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation?"
"Chef"
"Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!"
