"[wearing an argyle sweater] ...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. [cheers from the school crowd before him]"
"Principal Victoria"
"[approaches the mic] Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski."
"Mr. Mackey"
"[as Kyle approaches him] That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. [a shot of the council, which is comprised of five Latinos. ]"
"Kyle"
"Cool."
"Principal Victoria"
"All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman. [reads again in disbelief] Eric Cartman? [a smattering of applause from the kids in the crowd]"
"Cartman"
"[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back] Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez."
"Kids"
"Jennifer Lopez?"
"Kyle"
"No way."
"Cartman"
"[shows off his left hand, which is open] Miss Lopez, come on out here. [the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it]"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"[Cartman begins to speak in a Spanish cartoon accent and his lips form a tiny smile as his hand begins to move] Hallooo. [the hand sports a small wig and a paper cutout of a woman's body hanging down from it. The cutout wears a white top and shorts and a heavy brown coat. The cutout's right hand sports some yellow bracelets]"
"Principal Victoria"
"[taken aback] Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos."
"Cartman"
"Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Oh si, si. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress."
"Cartman"
"Oh, you mean this one? [whips out a doll's dress for the occasion]"

"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy."
"Cartman"
"And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. [Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation. The members of the Latino Endowment council jump up and down with joy and pride. Stan and Kenny clap with everyone else, Kyle is just stunned.]"
"Cartman"
"Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!"
"Kyle"
"It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture."
"Cartman"
"Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle."
"Kyle"
"No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!"
"Cartman"
"[walks up to Kyle] Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez."
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Aww, that makes me muy triste."
"Cartman"
"Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Oh si si, very much."
"Cartman"
"Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Oh si, si si, my kisses taste like tacos. [Cartman plants his fist on Kyle's lips and makes kissing noises, then removes the hand]"
"Cartman"
"Is nice?"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Is very nice. He's so handsome. [Cartman puts the hand back on Kyle's mouth and resumes the kissing noises]"
"Kyle"
"[swats Cartman's hand away]Stop it!"
"Cartman"
"Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court."
"Kenny"
"(Woohoo!) [the boys go to the food court]"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Mmm, tacos! So yummy!"
"Kyle"
"Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too."
"Kyle"
"She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"When you eat a taco it comes out your backside too, cholo!"
"Kenny"
"(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Look look! Make your own music video! [they stop in front of a ""U R Da Star"", a music-video shop]"
"Kyle"
"Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"I agree. Those places are stupid."
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"It's not stupid. I need to make music video."
"Stan"
"[to Cartman's hand] Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? [slaps Cartman's hand down] Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!"
"Cartman"
"Hey, I'm on your guys' side."

"Kyle"
"God dammit! [follows reluctantly]"
"Cashier"
"Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"How much to make a video?"
"Cashier"
"Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape."
"Cartman"
"Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Oh please! Come on, guys!"
"Kyle"
"Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!"
"Cartman"
"All right all right, here's ten dollars! [takes out the bill and hands it to the cashier]"
"Kyle"
"That's not what I meant!"
"Cashier"
"All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen. [Cartman walks over to the screen] What kind of song do you want?"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"

"Cashier"
"Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see it."

"Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! [rushes out and the cheering class and Mr. Slave follow]"
"Principal Victoria"
"Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?"
"Mr. Mackey"
"Here she comes! Here she comes!"
"Jennifer Lopez"
"Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!"
"Principal Victoria"
"[Mr. Adler takes a picture] J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?"
"Jennifer Lopez"
"[begins pacing] No! Shut up! If I find the ho who thinks she's taken my career from me, I'm gonna wring her pretty little neck!

"My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like tacos, and burritos."
"Jennifer Lopez"
"That? That's what replaced me?!"
"Cartman"
"I'm sure it was just a mistake."
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Only mistake was when this ghetto trash got signed in the first place!"
"Cartman"
"Shut your God-damned mouth!"
"Jennifer Lopez"
"[picks Cartman up by the scruff of his jacket] You fucking smartass, who do you think you are?!"
"Cartman"
"Nobody!"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"I am Yennifer Hrlopez! I eat tacos, and burritos!"

"What's the matter?"
"Cartman"
"I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez."
"Kyle"
"So stop doing it!"
"Cartman"
"Stop doing what?"
"Kyle"
"You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!"
"Cartman"
"Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and ""Jennifer Lopez"" emerges coughing]"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Don't you dare ever do that to me again!"
"Kyle"
"Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe!"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!"
"Kyle"
"I can see your lips moving!"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"I can see your lips moving too, culo!"
"Kyle"
"See?! I just saw your lips move!"
"Cartman"
"Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez."
"Stan"
"What's she doing?"
"Kyle"
"Come here! [drags Stan off to the dining room] You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!"
"Stan"
"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it."
"Kyle"
"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, [Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman] ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!"""
"Stan"
"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?"
"Kyle"
"YES, dude! [they then walk back into the living room]"
"Stan"
"Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you."
"Cartman"
"Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does."
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Oh no you don't!"
"Cartman"
"Quiet, Ms. Lopez."
"Kyle"
"Out! [walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out]"
"Cartman"
"Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]"
"Ben"
"There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! [Cartman decides to run in the other direction] Jenny? [Cartman sees a car pull up in front of him and then...]"
"Aide 1"
"Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! [Cartman decides to ran back towards Ben, but runs into a pair of female legs]"
"Jennifer Lopez"
"[disheveled, wielding a running chainsaw over her head] So you're gettin' married, huh? [revs up the motor, and Cartman makes his escape, screaming. In the background, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny have stepped out the door to see what's going on.]"
"Ben"
"Don't you hurt her!"
"BHI President"
"We'll sue you!"
"Kyle"
"Oh Jesus."
"Police Officer 1"
"Freeze, leafblower! [she drops the chainsaw and holds her hands up]"
"Aide 1"
"Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! [the arrest is made]"
"Police Officer 2"
"All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath."
"Ben"
"[rushes up to ""Jennifer Lopez""] Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!"
"Aide 2"
"Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive]"
"Ben"
"Our love is like rain!"
"Jennifer Lopez"
"That's what you said about me, asshole!"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Quiet!"
"BHI President"
"Get her out of here!"
"Jennifer Lopez"
"Fuck you!"
"Police Officer 2"
"Shut up, picante pants!"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"Everyone be quiet! [Everyone stops what they're doing and look at the hand] I'm... I'm not who you think I am."
"BHI President"
"You're not?"
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot continue anymore. I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am... [Cartman rips off the small wig he had on his hand and delivers a new voice] ...Mitch Connor. [everyone, including Kyle, gasps]"
"Police Officer 2"
"Who's Mitch Connor?"
"Mitch Connor"
"Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'."
"Kyle"
"[exasperated] Oh no, no, no."
"Mitch Connor"
"I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time."
"Kyle"
"Stop. It."
"Mitch Connor"
"Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart. [Ben begins to sob. Cartman walks to one side of the bridge] But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down. I wonder, will I dream? [as the sun drops below the horizon, Cartman opens his hand and a gust of wind is heard. Whatever was possessing the hand parted. Ben sobs once more as Cartman just stares in wonder]"
"Police Officer 2"
"Well, looks like Mitch Connor has cashed in his last chips. [everyone disperses except the boys. Ben stays on for a second, but he too leaves.]"
"Kyle"
"[the boys step forward] Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?"
"Cartman"
"I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?"
"Kyle"
"[resigns] All right. [Cartman beams] All right, I guess it's possible."
"Cartman"
"[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda!"
"Manager"
"Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce will go on. [a man carrying a large bowl walks up behind Lopez and bumps into her]"
"Jennifer Lopez"
"[jumping to one side] Ow. Look out, muffinhead!"
"Manager"
"Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people."
"Jennifer Lopez"
"Get a what with who?"
"Manager"
"Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?"
"Jennifer Lopez"
"[begins chopping the onions] This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working at a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!"
"Coworker"
"Yeah. Meee too."
"Cartman as Jennifer Lopez"
"[as credits roll]

You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget all about...
Tacos! Oh, tacos, so good in my tummy yummy yummy give me more.
