"Wendy"
"Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day."
"Stan"
"I know."
"Wendy"
"Maybe we should go on a cruise or something."
"Stan"
"I can't afford a cruise, dude."
"Wendy"
"I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise."
"Stan"
"Shut up, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"[still laughing] That is so-ho lame!"
"Cartman"
"Oh man, I..."
"Wendy"
" -and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married."
"Cartman"
"Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time."
"Principal Victoria"
"[Rushing in.] Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery."
"Principal Victoria"
"So you're going to have a substitute teacher."
"Principal Victoria"
"And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison."
"Principal Victoria"
"Yes, little boy?"
"Kyle"
"We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison."
"Principal Victoria"
"...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen."
"Ms. Ellen"
"[Brightly.] Hello, children."
"Stan, Kyle"
"Whoa!"
"Cartman"
"[Slowly.] Wow, she's pretty."
"Kenny"
"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
"Stan"
"You can say that again."
"Kenny"
"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
"Principal Victoria"
"Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,"
"Ms. Ellen"
"...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us."
"Wendy"
"[Gasps.] Stan? Stan?!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?"
"Cartman"
"[Brightly.] Yes, ma'am."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh."
"Stan"
"Yeu-bluuuch."
"Ms. Ellen"
"[A moment later.] Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?"
"Cartman"
"Noh, he always pukes when he's in love."
"Stan"
"I'll kick your ass, Cartman!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"So you're alright?"
"Stan"
"Bluuuch."
"Kyle"
"Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes."
"Tom"
"You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?"
"Mr. Hat"
"It sure is, Mr. Garrison!"
"Tom"
"Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Hmmm."
"Tom"
"Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh, that's not bad."
"Tom"
"Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this."
"Mr. Garrison"
"WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!"
"Tom"
"Alright-y then."
"Tom"
"Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food."
"Mr. Garrison"
"I can live with that."
"Tom"
"[Excitedly.] Alrighty then, let's get started!"
"Cartman"
"She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!"
"Kyle"
"Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she help but look at you!"
"Stan"
"You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!"
"Cartman"
"Until you puked on her."
"Chef"
"[Approaching.] Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?"
"Kyle"
"Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!"
"Chef"
"Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?"
"Stan"
"Yeah, that one!"
"Chef"
"Wooof! I've got to meet this woman."
"Wendy"
"[Approaching.] Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?"
"Stan"
"No."
"Wendy"
"Well it is!"
"Chef"
"That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other..."
"Kenny"
"(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)"
"Chef"
"Thaat's right!"
"Wendy"
"Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?"
"Chef"
"That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it..."
"Wendy"
"[Panicking a little.] Stan? We're still Valentines, right?"
"Stan"
"Sure, Wendy, whatever."
"Kyle"
"Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents"
"Stan"
"Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!"
"Cartman"
"I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners"
"Female singer"
"
I remember when we were still in love
The moments that we shared were timeless.
Saw it in the wind, knew it in a glance,
the songs we sang were simple reminders.

"
"(Montage)"
"[Moments from Wendy's time with Stan, Part I (he throws up every time)]
Stark's Pond: she comes up behind him and says, ""Hi, Stan""
Stark's Pond: she asks him to come with her (to get Cartman)
Cafeteria: she hands him a note (an invitation to Stark's Pond)
Cemetery: amid a field of dead zombies, she puckers up
Classroom: she hands him a daisy (he throws up with every step she takes)"
"Female singer"
"
I can't stop now[Wendy is sobbing somewhat]
My heart's awake
I feel your arms
My arms to take
I must have changed...

"
"(Montage)"
"[Moments from Wendy's time with Stan, Part II (he throws up every time)]
A vivid sunset: she snuggles up to him on the limb of a tree
Football practice: she cheers him on, he throws up, she looks away for an instant, and Cartman tackles him. Where's his helmet?
Cafeteria: he throws up as she approaches; she slips in it and falls flat on her back
Playground: Stan and Kyle are working those hobby elephants furiously when Wendy and Bebe approach (he threw up on her three times)
Woods: Stan and Wendy pucker up to kiss (after they got Ike back)"
"Female singer"
"
...Even when love is the same.[Wendy sheds another tear, then turns left and walks away]

"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?"
"Cartman"
"[Eagerly.] Memememememe, me!"
"Bebe"
"You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Stan, how about you?"
"Stan"
"Bluuch! I'd love to."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Cartman?"
"Cartman"
"What's a multiplication table?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Well, where did he leave off?"
"Cartman"
"We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while-"
"Chef"
"Oh, hello."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Can I help you?"
"Chef"
"[Eyebrows aflutter.] I'm Chef."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Aand?"
"Chef"
"I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground."
"Kyle"
"My laundry detergent?"
"Stan"
"That's not Kyle's..."
"Chef"
"Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place."
"Chef"
"What was your name again?"
"Cartman"
"Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen."
"Ms. Ellen"
"I'mm the substitute."
"Chef"
"Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you."
"Ms. Ellen"
"That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-"
"Chef (falsetto)"
"
[Music starts and he starts to sway]
Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!

"
"Stan"
"We've got to learn how to do that, dude!"
"Kyle"
"Yup!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?"
"Chef"
"If we can have dinner tonight."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Fine, Chef. [He grins.] Just let me do my job before I get fired."
"Cartman"
"Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Wwhat?!"
"Tom"
"Mr. Garrison. Mr. Garrison."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Where-eh, where am I?"
"Tom"
"The operation is over, Mr. Garrison."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?"
"Tom"
"You look great!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Ah-I feel kinda nauseous."
"Tom"
"Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, snapped some cartilage..."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Aauugh-huh."
"Tom"
"...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart."
"Mr. Garrison"
"UUUUUuuuuuugh"
"Tom"
"By the way, did you ever see that movie Contact?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible!"
"Tom"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest."
"Tom"
"I'll check on you a little later."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do."
"Cartman"
"[Enunciating.] Good-bye, Ms. Ellen."
"Kyle"
"[Looks back.] Stop kissing ass, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!"
"Wendy"
"Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Of course, Wendy."
"Wendy"
"I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life..."
"Wendy"
"Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Of course, Wendy."
"Wendy"
"Don't fuck with me!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"[Stunned.] Wha?"
"Wendy"
"You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle."
"Stan"
"[Feigning clearing his throat.] Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift."
"Ms. Ellen"
"And here's one from Kenny. [She opens it.] Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan."
"Stan"
"Bluuch."
"Ms. Ellen"
"And here's another present...from Wendy. [She opens it.] Oh. Why, it's a dead animal."
"Thank you, Wendy."
"Dialog"
"Stan"
"See? She liked my present the best!"
"Kyle"
"Where's your present, Cartman?"
"Cartman"
"Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now. [All gasp.] But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner."
"Cartman"
"Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Are there any questions before we begin?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Yes, Wendy?"
"Wendy"
"When someone gets as old as you,"
"Wendy"
"Do they have to wear Depends undergarments?"
"Kyle"
"Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!"
"Stan"
"No you're not! I don't think I missed any!"
"Wendy"
"Hi, Stan."
"Stan"
"I bet I scored 100!"
"Wendy"
"HI, STAN!"
"Stan"
"Oh, hi, Wendy."
"Wendy"
"I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen."
"Kyle"
"No, she wasn't!"
"Wendy"
"Yes, she was!"
"Stan"
"That's impossible!"
"Wendy"
"Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!"
"Cartman"
"Nuh-uh!"
"Wendy"
"It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!"
"Kyle"
"Oh cool."
"Cartman"
"Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!"
"Kyle"
"Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy."
"Wendy"
"NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!"
"Cartman"
"Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass."
"Chef"
"[Somberly.] Hello there, children."
"Cartman"
"Oh, hi, Chef."
"Kyle"
"How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?"
"Chef"
"Not too good."
"Stan"
"What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?"
"Chef"
"No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team."
"Chef"
"Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion."
"Chef"
"Don't you understand? She's a lesbian."
"Stan"
"A whatbian?"
"Kyle"
"A plebeian?"
"Chef"
"You boys don't know what a lesbian is?"
"Stan"
"Kenny?"
"Stan"
"No, explain it to us, Chef."
"Chef"
"Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians."
"Stan"
"Oh."
"Chef"
"Now move along, children, you're holding up the line!"
"Kyle"
"Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?"
"Stan"
"Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!"
"Kyle"
"Hey, yeah!"
"Cartman"
"You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian."
"Stan"
"You're just saying that, Cartman."
"Kyle"
"Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat-ass."
"Cartman"
"I am, too!"
"Tom"
"Okay, only a few more bandages to go."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Well?"
"Tom"
"Take a look for yourself."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?"
"Mr. Hat"
"I think it looks great."
"Tom"
"Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll really notice the difference."
"Stan"
"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?"
"Cartman"
"My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet."
"Kyle"
"Really?"
"Stan"
"Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect."
"Kyle"
"And I got these killer Birken-stocks."
"Indiglo Girls singer"
"
I woke up very early one Sunday morn...

"
"Cartman"
"This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Hi, Mrs. Campbell."
"Mrs. Campbell"
"[Breathlessly.] Oh, How-dy Mr. Garrison. Se-hey, honey, you look kinda differe-hent-huh."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Really?"
"Mrs. Campbell"
"Did you get a haircut?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"No, but thanks for asking."
"Mrs. Campbell"
"[Waving at him.] Call me! I'm in the book!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us."
"Wendy"
"Thanks for coming over, Bebe."
"Bebe"
"That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?"
"Wendy"
"That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe."
"Bebe"
"Really?"
"Wendy"
"Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover."
"Bebe"
"Oh, cool."
"Stan"
"I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am."
"Cartman"
"I'm a bigger lesbian than you!"
"Stan"
"No, you're a fatter lesbian than me."
"Kyle"
"Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!"
"Clyde"
"Whoa."
"Clyde"
"Is that Wendy Testaburger?"
"Wendy"
"Hi guys, what's up?"
"Cartman"
"Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John."
"Stan"
"Wow. Hi, Wendy."
"Wendy"
"Oh. Hi, Stan."
"Wendy"
"I think it worked, Bebe."
"Bebe"
"[Pleased.] Yeah."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Good morning, children."
"Stan"
"Wow!"
"Cartman"
"Dang! That's nice!"
"Kyle"
"Yeah!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"We're like sisters!"
"Wendy"
"DIE!!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Hello there, children!"
"Stan"
"Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back."
"Cartman"
"Oh, weak, dude!"
"Wendy"
"Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!"
"Wendy"
"He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Children, I have a very important announcement to make."
"Mr. Garrison"
"I'm quitting my job as a teacher."
"Wendy"
"Wwhat?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks."
"Wendy"
"You...you can't."
"Mr. Garrison"
"But the good news is,"
"Mr. Garrison"
"I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher."
"Class"
"Hooray!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Really?"
"Principal Victoria"
"That's right. Will you stay?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Wel...sure!"
"Wendy"
"Noooo! Noooo!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan."
"Stan"
"Bluuch. Kick ass!"
"Wendy"
"Nooo!! Nooo!!"
"Principal Victoria"
"Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died."
"Wendy"
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!"
"Principal Victoria"
"Oh, my! What an exciting day!"
"Photographer"
"Great, baby, you're looking great!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"I'm a lady killer, Mr. Hat."
"Mr. Hat"
"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
"Photographer"
"Okay, just a few hundred more shots and we'll be done!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"A few hundred?"
"Photographer"
"Hey, that's the life of a model, baby."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack."
"Photographer"
"You've got it! [The photo-shoot continues.]"
"Ms. Ellen"
"I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education."
"Stan"
"Are we making love now?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Excuse me?"
"Stan"
"They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet."
"Ms. Ellen"
"What are you talking about?"
"Stan"
"You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends."
"Stan"
"But why?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Well first of all, you're eight."
"Stan"
"It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Oh boy."
"Wendy"
"It's over. I give up."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring."
"Mr. Hat"
"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
"Mr. Garrison"
"What the...?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself!"
"Kyle"
"So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?"
"Cartman"
"Did you make love?"
"Stan"
"I think so."
"Cartman"
"No way!"
"Stan"
"Yup."
"Kyle"
"Down by the fire?"
"Stan"
"Yup."
"Kenny"
"(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)"
"Stan"
"Did I what?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Good morning, children. "
"Wendy"
"Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?"
"Wendy"
"No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Oh, that's okay, Wendy."
"Wendy"
"No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Well, I would love that, Wendy."
"Wendy"
"And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,"
"Wendy"
"...and I've learned from it."
"Wendy"
"I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world."
"Ms. Ellen"
"Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!"
"Cartman"
"That's not what we just heard!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Hoh Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job."
"Woman"
"Oh my God, did he...?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting."
"Leader"
"Down! Down! Everybody down!"
"Cartman"
"What the hell...?"
"Leader"
"So! We meet again, Ms. Ellen!"
"Principal Victoria"
"And just what is going on here, mister?"
"Leader"
"I am Hakeem Korashki, of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"It's a lie!"
"Korashki"
"She has killed thousands, and will kill again, I assure you!"
"Principal Victoria"
"Ms. Ellen, is this true?"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Nooo!"
"Korashki"
"We must take her back to Iraq immediately!"
"Wendy"
"Oh, coool!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Principal Victoria, please."
"Korashki"
"Here is a black-and-white photo of Ms. Ellen with our leader. [Shows photo.] Her real name is Makesh Alak Makarakesh."
"Principal Victoria"
"Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"NOOOO!!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"GET AWAY FROM ME!! UUGH!!"
"Stan"
"Oh my God, she killed Kenny!"
"Kyle"
"You bastard!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"NOOOOOOO!!"
"Wendy"
"Wow."
"Wendy"
"What incredible irony."
"Stan"
"Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive."
"Wendy"
"Yeah, you just never know."
"Stan"
"Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff."
"Wendy"
"Happy Valentine's Day, Staan."
"Stan"
"Bluuuuch!"
"Wendy"
"Eeewwww!"
"Stan"
"Sorry."
"Wendy"
"No, it's okay, Stan!"
"Wendy"
"Everything's going to be o-kay!"
"Kyle"
"Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!"
"Cartman"
"Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box."
"Korashki"
"For crimes against this country, you are hereby sentenced to be shot into the center of the sun!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Egh."
"Ms. Ellen"
"This is all a mistake!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"This can't be happening!"
"Ms. Ellen"
"Pleease! For the love of God!"
"Korashki"
"Shove off!!"
"Mrs. Campbell"
"Wo-hoo-hoo! Great party, Wendy!"
"Wendy"
"Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher."
"Mrs. Campbell"
"Anything for you, sugar-pie!"
"Wendy"
"Oh, hi, Kyle!"
"Kyle"
"I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange."
"Wendy"
"U-huh. Excuse me."
"Wendy"
"Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!"
"Iraqi"
"Ka fahra qetlaq humblaq! [Greetings...]"
"Wendy"
"Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!"
"Iraqi"
"Kuhla shaluah lakhenblaturtulah!"
"Wendy"
"Kaqemblaq!"
"Iraqi"
"Ah, laqeh blakatah!"
"Kyle"
"How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-"
"Wendy"
"Wait, wait!"
"Wendy"
"It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing!"
"Wendy"
"Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen."
"Kyle"
