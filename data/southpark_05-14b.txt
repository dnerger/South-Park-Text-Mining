"
"You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.

"...Uh, who's Jack?

"Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.

"It won't? Oh, good.

"It's so very hard to lose a loved one, isn't it?
"
"Yes, it, it sure is.
"
"Thank goodness we have each other to share our grief.
"
"Thank goodness.
"
"[points towards the entrance] Here he is. [a door is heard opening and in walks...]
"
"John! Patsy!
"
"Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit. [Condit approaches the table, waves hello, and takes a seat next to Linda] He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids.
"
"We're goin' tuh get that sonofabitch! [grins. That grin is fixed in place]
"
"Yes, I'd I sure hope we do.
"
"I spoke with the FBI and Some Puerto Rican Guy has just made their Number One Most Wanted, heh.
"
"Oh, good. Maybe now they'll catch him. [the door is heard opening again] Oh, here's another member of our support group. [waves hello] O.J.
"
"[waves] Hey guys.
"
"Chris, Linda, you know O.J. Simpson. [O.J. walks up and shakes Linda's hand]
"
"Oh. Sure.
"
"O.J.'s wife was killed by an uh, Some Puerto Rican Guy, too.
"
"Yup, it was Some Puerto Rican Guy all right.
"
"So you see, Chris and Linda, there are people like you all over the country who've been affected by Some Puerto Rican Guy.
"
"Hey! Let's make Chris and Linda an official part of the group.
"
"Yeah!
"
"Yeah!
"
"Alright!
"
"[waves her knife like a conductor's baton] One of us! One of us!
"
"Gooble gobble gooble gobble!
"
"[joins Condit] One of us!
"
"[the two lines happen together]
"
"One of us! One of us!
"
"One of us! Gooble gobble!
"
"Gooble gobble! Gooble gobble! One of us! One of us! [the Stotches look at the other four in fear]
"
"[The scary road, night. The skies have cleared to reveal a bright full moon. The camera moves down to the road and Butters comes into view singing to himself]
"
"
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's[a shadow flies over the trees in front of him, and an eerie cry is heard. He stops]Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
[a snarling sound is heard. He stops and turns right, looking into the trees]
Uhuh, hello?[after a while of looking, he turns left and starts walking again]So come and eat at...


"
"[whispering] Why can't he see us?
"
"...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
[the eerie sound is heard again, and three red dots are aimed at his forehead - he has been targeted by someone, or something... He turns right again and looks into the trees. Someone looks back, and turns on thermal vision. A neon view of Butters is shown. Butters turns left and start walking again. The three dots remain trained on his forehead]
Oh, nutsack [moves his hands to his mouth and gasps a bit] Oops.

"[""The Butters Show"" splash screen]
"
"Everyone knows it's Butters!
"
"[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
"
"[Butters' house, day, the anniversary has arrived. Inside, Chris and Linda are fighting over the details of the unfolding story of Butters' disappearance. He sits on the sofa; she's pacing the floor, crying, and both are unkempt]
"
"Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican! [rises] You have to learn to keep it straight!
"
"I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
"
"Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! [the door opens and Butters walks in]
"
"Don't forget: your lies started all this. [Butters closes the door]
"
"My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! [Butters approaches and looks]
"
"Happy Anniversary!
"
"Not now, Butters!
"
"Oh. [moves off to his left] Alright, then. I-
"
"Butters?? [spots him and scoops him up, then shares him with Chris]Oh, Butters!
"
"Son! I don't believe it! [they both drop on one knee as they hold on to Butters]
"
"Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
"
"Oh, my baby's back!
"
"I ain't grounded, am I?
"
"No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why... [relief fades to spin] Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?
"
"Lie?
"
"Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.
"
"No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! [both parents set Butters down and rise]
"
"Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
"
"Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
"
"[over Butters' voice] Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!
"
"You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
"
"Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.
"
"Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!
"
"Now gosh darn it, you! [steps in between his parents] You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble! [Chris and Linda listen] Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here [puts his right hand to his chin, palm down] with you two! [a few seconds of silence follow]
"
"...Butters... You're as right as rain.
"
"[genuflects and messes with Butters' hair] You sure are.
"
"Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
"
"No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world. [Chris walks over to the phone as Linda and Butters look at each other] And I am so happy you're alive.
"
"...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
"
"You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing...]
"
"[Butters' house, day. The news media and the spectators are back at the Stotch house for another press conference.. The front door opens and the Stotches step forth to the podium, all cleaned up and well-dressed. Cameramen begin taking pictures]
"
"We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. [Butters comes out of the house to stand next to his parents, and cheers are heard in the crowd. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are present]
"
"Wow, alright
"
"Butters was missing?
"
"But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.
"
"[points at the crowd] Yeah!
"
"We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
"
"Yeah! [a shot of the Ramseys, O.J., and Condit]
"
"You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.
"
"[raises both arms in victory] Ye-! [turns to look at his father, and his arms go down] wait, what?
"
"Huho!
"
"[Butters is now afraid of what she might say] And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.
"
"Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!
"
"Damn, dude.
"
"So you see, there was no ""Some Puerto Rican Guy."" He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, ""You're a liar! You're a LIAR!"" [points at the crowd, and Condit's fixed-grin face is shown] ""You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!"" [back to Chris] Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, ""Hello,"" but they'd be thinking, ""Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"" [a shot of O.J.] ""You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!"" [back to Chris] And to me, people might say things like, [a shot of Condit] ""LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!"" [back to Chris] And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like, [a shot of the Ramseys] ""You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!"" [a shot of O.J.] ""CONFESS!"" [a shot of Condit] ""LIAR! CONFESS!"" [back to Chris] You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.
"
"We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
"
"And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.
"
"Yeah-ah-alright! [the parents go back in the house as a stunned Butters stands on the walkway. The crowd disperses and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk up to Butters]
"
"Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
"
"Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
"
"We sure are.
"
"I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
"
"Really?
"
"Naw, I'm lyin'
"
"[appears in the doorway] Let's go, son.
"
"Wuh comin', Dad! [goes inside the house]
"
"Everyone knows it's Butters!
"
"[returns to the doorway and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
