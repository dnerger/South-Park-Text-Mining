"[The USGS in Colorado. Four men are shown at their desks working. Nelson is front and center, Randy is behind him to his right, and two more men work behind them]
"
"I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
"
"I didn't see the game.
"
"[soft sneeze] You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
"
"Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
"
"A musical? [laughs and rises from his chair to approach him] Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! [laughs while moving around the desk]
"
"[bearded] Good for you, Nelson. Did you get a blowjob afterwards?
"
"Sure did.
"
"[clean-shaven] Niice. [Randy's smile turns into a frown]
"
"What?
"
"I took my girl to see that show last week. Got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards.
"
"Forty-five minutes non-stop.
"
"[surprised, then] Nuh uh.
"
"It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
"
"[looks back at him for a few seconds] Noh uh.
"
"I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
"
"Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
"
"Wicked.
"
"[interested] Oh. Wicked.
"
"[Denver, night. Wicked is playing]

...Heaven knows we know what goodness isO heaven knows wicked people aren't good.From head to toe, she was just wicked peopleHead to toe...She wasn't good, to know what goodness is...

"[During the song, Sharon has her hands over her heart and she's thoroughly enchanted. Randy studies her reactions. Onstage several actors sing their hearts out. One actress descends from the rafters on a large circular ornament. Randy keeps studying Sharon]
"
"Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
"
"Nono, I'm good, thanks.

"Can I get a scotch and soda? [the bartender goes off to prepare it]
"
"Enjoying the show?
"
"[nervous at first] Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
"
"No?
"
"To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
"
"Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is ""blowjob.""
"
"Subliminal messages?
"
"It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it ""subtext."" Just listen really, really closely.

"[The auditorium. Randy returns to his seat]

"And new loves cry ... defying ................... gravity ...

"....... Suddenly ... Don't you love free love blowjobs?

"[The drive home. Sharon's happily looking up beyond the car ceiling]
"
"Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head. [swoons a bit, then looks at Randy, then at his crotch, then at him again] Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? [looks at his crotch again. Randy looks at her in surprise. She giggles and takes off her seatbelt, then leans over and begins to give him a blowjob]

"[softly] Whoa, no way!

"Do something, you stupid vegan!

"Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!

"How long was it?
"
"She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.

"Nice, bro!

"Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.

"What was the show about?
"
"Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.

"[The diving board. Larry is still crying up there. Shelly makes her move.]

"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! [Shelly walks up the little ladder to the board and jumps up and down]

"Go! Go! [Larry bounces up and down crying, but doesn't fall into the water]
"
"[The other end of the pool]
"
"Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
"
"Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!
"
"Really??
"
"Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker.
"
"[The Marsh house. Sharon is at the computer when Randy walks in]

"[gets off the chair] What?? Randy, are you serious??

"No. Dad. Please don't do this!

"[The Feegan home, arguably the nicest house ever shown in South Park. The Feegans are indeed vegans, eating a dinner of mushrooms, alfalfa sprouts, vegan hot dogs, and tofu. They're also something of survivalists, as they all wear life preservers]
"
"It takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world! You get labeled ""soft"" or ""silly."" [he must have been talking for a while, for Stan and Shelly look bored] But the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products. Would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan?
"
"Yes.
"
"Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!
"
"Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. [Larry is stunned and drops his fork, then looks as his parents' reactions. His parents are stunned too, but grow angry]
"
"He does decide for himself! Larry's been a vegan since he was born! [Larry waves at her to keep going]
"
"Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. [Larry signals for her to keep 'em coming]
"
"You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets.

Randy notices and the man puts up his left thumb. Randy approves with his right thumb. The doors open and everyone exits ""Sister Act.""

"
"Sounds like a dream, bro.
"
"It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is ""Wicked"" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
"
"And Wicked moves to Seattle in a couple of weeks.
"
"It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.

"Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.

"Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?

"Huh?

"Really? I would love a blowjob.

"A woman should give blowjobs on football Sunday

"Give you husband a blowjob when you get home.
"
"[to Lady 2, dressed in pink] And what about you, my fair lady? Could I trouble you for a quick Lewinsky?
"
"Oh I don't know, kind sir. Blowjobs seem a little degrading to me.

"Come now, a blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart.

"What do you want, Larry? [Larry raises the daisy up slowly, presenting it to her]

"Sit down, Mr. Marsh, we need to have a talk. [Randy takes a seat]
"
"We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
"
"Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
"
"You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!
"
"Musicals are about subtext!
"
"My musical has lots of subtext.
"
"""A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work.""
"
"And then she does. It's a metaphor.
"
"Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen""?!
"
"Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!

"[rises] Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!

"You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!
"
"Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards! [rises, moving his chair aside] And now I need to get back to rehearsals. [leaves, then stops and turns around] Oh. And if ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. [turns around and walks out]

"[The Marsh house, day. Larry walks up and knocks. Shelly opens the door and they look at each other for a few seconds. Larry now has a tiny guitar]

"[leads the group of Randy's friends] Randy! Randy, brah!
"
"[to the cast] Uh, and hold. [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. [the actors are frozen in place] What is it now?
"
"Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down.
"
"[stunned at first, then gets angry] Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! [leaves the table and walks up the aisle towards the exit]

"Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him.

"
"They're having such a great time together. I really wanna thank you, Sharon.
"
"No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
"
"I have to admit it makes me a little nervous having Larry up there without a life preserver on, but I guess we have to take changes sometimes.
"
"That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
"
"That's right, I, I hear his musical is getting a lot of attention, that it really has a chance of making it.
"
"Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.

"You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical.

"
"Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
"
"Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.

"Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
"
"Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
"
"Of course not, go ahead, hun.
"
"[heads for the stairs] Alright babe.
"
"I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
"
"Okay. What's Shelly doing?
"
"I gave her those tickets to ""Wicked."" [Randy stops and looks back at Sharon] She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.

"[does a double take, then plants his hands on the bannister] She's WHAT?!
"
"Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see ""Wicked"" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.

"OH! [runs back outside] Shelly! Hold on! [closes the door. Sharon just watches him go and smiles]
"
"[On the road to Denver. Randy has gone back for Sharon and is driving madly down the road. He mows down a mailbox]

"Why does it matter?!
"
"She's too young for that stuff!

"That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
"
"I can't!
"
"WHY?!
"
"Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
"
"[crosses her arms and looks away] That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
"
"D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw ""Wicked""?
"
"Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-
"
"And after ""Lion King"" in New York? ""Godspell""? ""Mamma Mia""?
"
"Oh my gosh.
"
"Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
"
"Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
"
"No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.

"It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw ""Grease"" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we- [gasps and puts her hands over her heart] Oh my God!

"[Outside the playhouse. Randy stumbles and falls in front of Creepy City Costumes & Novelties. Sharon catches up with him]

"[During the song, a shot of Larry and Shelly is shown. Onstage a witch moves towards on stage, only to be kicked away by Randy as he swings down from the rafters]

"Ohhhh.

"[Randy comes back around and kicks down another actor. He then swings up into the audience and almost kicks a man in the balcony]
"
"Hey, it's Spider-Man

"[on his way down, Randy kicks a few audience members out of their seats]

"Sorry! Sorry.

"[Randy knocks out three more cast members on stage, then goes up into the rafter. He strikes a water main and knocks out the valve, releasing the water onto the stage and audience]

"[looks in, then opens the door some more and enters] Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight.

Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy! [looks at Sharon] I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you. [lies down] I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.

"I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
"
"Really?
"
"[sits up] Oh Randy, [kneels before him. Randy sits up] the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
