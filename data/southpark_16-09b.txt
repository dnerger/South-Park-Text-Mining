"[Wall-Mart, night. The boys are in the sporting goods section if the store. Kenny looks at bats while Cartman looks at gloves. Stan and Kyle look at other things across the aisle.]
"
"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
"
"[looks over his left shoulder] Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? [looks at the gloves again]
"
"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
"
"[turns left to address Kyle] I'm not fat, Kyle.
"
"Right, you're not fat.
"
"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like [that] bitch! [they see a scooter rolls past them with an obese man on it]
"
"Whoa duude!
"
"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? [another obese man rolls up behind them]
"
"Excuse me. [They just look up at him] Excuse me! [they part the aisle for him - Stan, Cartman and Kenny take the side with the gloves on it, Kyle takes the other side,]
"
"See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
"
"Why do they even allow those things in stored?
"
"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. [Indeed, a small fleet of them are available for rent, at $19.99 each. They're labeled as electric wheelchairs. Obese people are in line as one after another of them rents a Rascal. The boys turn a corner to have a look at the Rascals as they're being rented]
"
"You've gotta be kidding me!
"
"[eyes some Oreos and goes for them] Oh my God you guys, look at this! [grabs a box and reads it] Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling. [closes his eyes and looks up joyfully] Holy hell yes!
"
"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all?? [an obese man and an obese woman squeeze past each other in an aisle on their scooters.] That's YOU one day, fatass![Stan and Kenny leave] Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! [turns and follows Stan and Kenny away. Cartman is left alone with the Oreos and his thoughts]
"
"[rolls up in her Rascal] Are those Candy Corn Oreos?
"
"Yeah... Yeah, here you go. [walks over, tosses them into her basket, and walks away with his head down]
"
"[Cartman walks through town. He stops by a large window to look at himself, then walks on. Later he shows up at Kyle's house, and Kyle answers the door]
"
"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
"
"Why? [his eyebrows move to odd positions every so often]
"
"[walks in] I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart. [stops] You're right Kyle. I'm fat. [sighs] All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
"
"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
"
"[turns around] No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it. [walks out of the house. Kyle is puzzled. Moments later, Cartman returns on a Rascal and rolls on into Kyle's living room] Sweeeeeeeeeet!
"
"[angrily]Oh no!
"
"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. [begins to ride in a circle around Kyle]
"
"You don't need that! Get off of it.
"
"[stops] Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. [rides away]
"
"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
"
"[reaches the restroom and tries to get it, but the base is too wide] Hmm. [tries again. Kyle catches up] I can't. [tries again] I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. [tries again]
"
"What??
"
"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle. [tries again] You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. [tries again]
"
"So take a shit somewhere else!
"
"That's not the way this country works, Kyle. [tries again] Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter. [tries again] It's the law.
"
"[arrives] What's going on down here?
"
"[tries again] Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible. [tries again] I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit. [backs out and prepares to leave] Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. [rolls away. Kyle looks on angrily]
"
"[Cartman rides through town looking self-satisfied while music plays in the background]
"
"[""Nobody understands how embarrassing it is to live with obesity."" He rides past a couple] Out of the way. Out of the way please. [""Wherever you go, you're treated differently"" He arrives at a Denny's]
"
"Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window. [Cartman goes towards the booth and grins]
"
"[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman's soliloquy continues. ""You're made to feel different. To feel like less of a person."" While the boys are in the gym tossing basketballs at each other, Cartman rides around in the hall outside, grinning all the while. Next, Cartman holds up traffic while riding his Rascal. ""I feel so much shame, all I can do is try to make myself feel a little better by flying to Disneyland on the weekend.""]
"
"Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh...
"
"Coming through. Oh how humiliating. [now at the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland: ""But even at Disneyland I get reminded of my weight."" He rolls into the short line] Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel. [reaches the front of the line] Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have- [finds a line of other scooter riders in front of him] Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
"
"I don't have legs.
"
"Yeah, well you got skinny arms! [Later on, Cartman rolls through Cnderella's Castle. ""And then even Disneyland can't take away the shame, as all the people suffering from obesity are ignored. Like, we're invisible."" A woman's baby carriage gets in the way and she quickly pulls it back as Cartman rolls towards the exits] 'Scuse me. Move it.
"
"[A courtroom, day. Cartman has been explaining things to the judge at the witness stand... on his Rascal.]
"
"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy? [chokes up and begins to sob] At Besty Buy I'm sorry. [At the defense table sits a Best Buy employee, looking around] To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom? [reaches for a long-handled grip with his left hand, then uses it to take a tissue from the judge's bench. He grabs the tissue with his right hand and lowers the grip, then blows his nose] Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
"
"[News 4 segment.]
"
"More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping.
"
"[being jostled in his Rascal by a group of boys] Stop it you kids! sto- Oop- Owww.[the boys succeed in tipping him over and the man is on his side unable to get up. The kids laugh and scatter, and the man begins to sound like a pig] Weak! Weak!
"
"The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. [The device is shown, and it resembles a telescoping cane]
"
"[South Park Elementary gymnasium, day. Two workers are installing the tip assist device on Cartman's Rascal. Cartman is on his Rascal, and they're both on their sides. When the workers finish, he activates the device, which rights him up]
"
"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. [facing him is the rest of the fourth grade class]
"
"You have got to be kidding me!
"
"What, Kyle?! [the device then collapses and puts itself away]
"
"We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
"
"[rolls up to him] You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
"
"So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
"
"Oh! Oh, did you hear him?! [rolls back to the workers] This is exactly what Adele is talking about! [begins to pace back and forth] Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle! [rolls up to Kyle] Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day [rolls away] to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers! [rolls back up to Kyle] You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look! [rolls to the far end of the gum] I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
"
"Who's Honey Boo Boo?
"
"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
"
"[A trophy room. Honey Boo Boo is showing off her trophies from the various beauty pageants she's won]
"
"My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches. [at a pageant, onstage, dressed to win] I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!
"
"Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew.
"
"[back in her trophy room] I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!
"
"[at a pageant, performs some chest compressions on Honey] Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo! [Honey Boo Boo comes to] Now get up and wave to them judges! [later on, to the camera] We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy. [Stan and Kyle are watching the show in Stan's living room. Kyle gets up and walks off]
"
"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
"
"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
"
"[At sea, day, there's the U.S.S. James Cameron, with James Cameron on the bridge]
"
"This is it! Throttle down!
"
"[voice only] Throttle down! [Cameron leaves the bridge and goes on deck, putting on a diving suit]
"
"Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?
"
"I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
"
"The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron.
"
"Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters? [points at him] How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME. [puts on some gloves and gets into a bathysphere. He closes the hatch and locks himself in] Let her go! [two workers pull down the release switches in unison. The crane releases the bathysphere and... it hits the deck below. It rolls to one side towards the edge and then drops off. Under the water, as it sinks, Cameron gets to work] UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on.
"
"
His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!James Cameron.

"Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
"
"James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea
"
"Yes, James, we hear the song.

"
"With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.
"
"[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The fourth grade boys need to use the restroom. Kyle is pounding at the door, which has been locked from inside]
"
"Come on, hurry it up in there! [inside, a toilet and the two urinals have been removed to make room for the wheelchair-accessible toilet. Cartman rolls up the ramp to get to the toilet]
"
"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. [gets off the Rascal]
"
"[starting to fume, steps away from the crowd] This has gone far enough! [the other boys turn to look at him] How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
"
"Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
"
"Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
"
"Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
"
"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
"
"[walks up to Kyle] At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.
"
"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
"
"Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
"
"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! [walks away smiling. Token watches him leave, then walks off in the opposite direction. The rest of the boys go back to waiting at the restroom door. Craig watches Kyle leave, then notices Token and follows him]
"
"Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.
"
"He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. [hurries away]
"
"[University of Colorado at Boulder. Kyle is there to present his video on obesity. He's onstage before a large audience]

Another shot of him pooping. The crowd begins to laugh at his antics. Next he's at the dining room table waiting for his powdered doughnut pancake surprise. Kyle looks at the audience's reaction, then at the pilot, which now shows Cartman ordering some stuff from the Wendell's drive-through menu. Then it shows Cartman making a beeline for Disneyland]

"Come in.
"
"[enters and approaches the desk] What have you done?
"
"I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.
"
"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
"
"Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
"
"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
"
"[hops off his chair and walks to a window] I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel. [turns around and faces Kyle] If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?
"
"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
"
"But she's not black, Kyle. She's white. [a few seconds of silence] The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up. [faces the window again] Not by us, or anyone else.
"

"
"You guys seeing this?!
"
"Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron.
"
"This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.
"
"[Stan's house, porch. Stan sits on the steps as Kyle paces on the lawn]
"
"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
"
"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
"
"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
"
"[alarmed, gets up and walks up to Kyle] Dude! Dude, not cool!

"
"[falling to the ground] Ow!
"
"[Cartman looks back, then turns around and rides up to Honey Boo Boo as she gets up, then bumps her down again. The audience is disappointed at this. She gets up much faster this time and waits for Cartman to make his move. He rushes at her again, but she jumps onto him and delivers a flurry of punches at his face. Kyle walks around looking lost. Honey Boo Boo succeeds in knocking Cartman over and he's on his side. Honey delivers several kicks to Cartman's head and begins to squeal like a pig.

"
"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?

[Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]And then I started thinking, maybe it was us. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.
