"Sharon"
"Now blow out the candles grandpa."
"Sharon"
"Hurray!!!"
"Randy"
"How's it feel to be 102, paps?"
"Grandpa"
"Shoot me."
"Sharon"
"Make a wish grandpa."
"Grandpa"
"I wish I were dead"
"Randy"
"Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa."
"Grandpa"
"I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old."
"Sharon"
"Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?"
"Shelly"
"I will."
"Randy"
"Me."
"Stan"
"It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on."
"Shelly"
"That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid."
"Stan"
"Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?"
"Sharon"
"Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you."
"Stan"
"Aw, dammit!"
"Sharon"
"Language."
"TV Announcer"
"And now back to Terrance & Phillip."
"Phillip Niles Argyle"
"Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart."
"Terrance Henry Stoot"
"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb."
"Stan"
"Heheheh hehehe..."
"Grandpa"
"Uhhhhh"
"Grandpa"
"Ah, dammit!"
"Granpa"
"How would you like to make a dollar Billy?"
"Stan"
"My name's not Billy grandpa, it's Stan."
"Grandpa"
"Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?"
"Stan"
"Sure."
"Grandpa"
"Ok. You just have to do one thing for me."
"Stan"
"I'm not gonna kill you grandpa."
"Grandpa"
"Why not?"
"Stan"
"'Cause, I'll get in trouble."
"Grandpa"
"I killed my grandpa when I was your age."
"Stan"
"Leave me alone grandpa."
"Grandpa"
"What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents."
"Phillip"
"Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too."
"Terrance"
"Ohhh, you farted."
"Sheila Broflovski"
"Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?"
"Terrance"
"Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?"
"Phillip"
"I sure would Terrance."
"Terrance"
"Alrighty then, here's a two-lip."
"Sheila"
"What is this?"
"Sheila"
"It's horrible!"
"Kyle"
"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip."
"Phillip"
"Take that you stupid dick."
"Sheila"
"What did he say?"
"Terrance"
"You're an asshole Phillip."
"Sheila"
"Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?"
"Shiela"
"Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!"
"Kyle"
"But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip."
"Sheila"
"Oh really? Is that so?"
"Terrance"
"Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart."
"Phillip"
"You're exactly right Terrance. Oh."
"Terrance"
"Oh no."
"Cartman"
"Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!"
"Liane"
"Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth."
"Cartman"
"That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!"
"Liane"
"Ohhh, okay hon."
"Stan"
"I'm not going to kill you grandpa!"
"Grandpa"
"Ingrate!"
"Stan"
"Good night grandpa."
"Grandpa"
"You pompous son of a whore!"
"Student"
"Huh huh, I had another ..."
"Kyle"
"Ow! What the hell was that for?!"
"Cartman"
"That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!"
"Clyde"
"Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?"
"Kyle"
"Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own."
"Cartman"
"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night."
"Cartman"
"[Tauntingly.] Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip."
"Class"
"Yeahh, woohoo!"
"Mr. Hat"
"Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison."
"Mr. Garrison"
"That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds."
"Mr. Garrison"
"You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Kenny, why are you late to class?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Oh, okay Kenny, be seated."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because..."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Yes Kenny, what is it?"
"Kenny"
"(I have to go pee.)"
"Mr. Garrison"
"I thought you just came from the bathroom."
"Kenny"
"(I did, I gotta go again...)"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Okay okay, go ahead."
"Mr. Garrison"
"As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment."
"Stan"
"Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Pay attention children!"
"Mr. Garrison"
"I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever."
"Cartman"
"What?"
"Clyde"
"Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"That's right children. Are there any questions?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Yes, Stanley?"
"Stan"
"Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"What, what do you mean?"
"Stan"
"My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should."
"Kyle"
"Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna."
"Stan"
"Really??"
"Kyle"
"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all."
"Stan"
"Wow!"
"Cartman"
"Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!"
"Stan"
"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?"
"Mr. Garrison"
"Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole."
"Kenny"
"(Oh my God!)"
"Kenny"
"(Owww!) [Splatterrrrr!]"
"Cartman"
"Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal."
"Stan"
"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late."
"Kyle"
"But won't your grandpa be there?"
"Stan"
"Yeah..."
"Cartman"
"Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money."
"Chef"
"Hello there children."
"Stan"
"Hey Chef."
"Chef"
"How's it goin'?"
"Stan"
"Bad."
"Chef"
"Why bad?"
"Stan"
"Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?"
"Chef"
"You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on."
"Stan"
"No, I mean, kill my grandpa."
"Chef"
"No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal."
"Stan"
"See, I told you dude."
"Kyle"
"Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?"
"Cartman"
"Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?"
"Chef"
"I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole."
"Stan"
"What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this."
"Sheila"
"And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean."
"Terrance"
"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
"Phillip"
"What?"
"Terrance"
"Fart."
"Sheila"
"Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny."
"Randy"
"Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh."
"Sheila"
"Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor..."
"Mr. Garrison"
"Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters."
"Townsman"
"Ha ha, green apple splatters."
"Grandpa"
"Uhhhh."
"Stan"
"Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay."
"Grandpa"
"Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet."
"Stan"
"No grandpa, I'll get in trouble."
"Grandpa"
"Kill me, God dammit!"
"Stan"
"No, I can't even kill a deer."
"Grandpa"
"Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?"
"Cartman"
"I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off."
"Grandpa"
"Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch."
"Cartman"
"What!"
"Grandpa"
"That's right."
"Stan"
"Grandpa!"
"Grandpa"
"And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too."
"Cartman"
"Hey!"
"Grandpa"
"Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma."
"Cartman"
"You piece of crap! I'll kill you!"
"Grandpa"
"That's the spirit Tubby."
"Stan"
"Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you."
"Cartman"
"Don't talk about my mom like that!"
"Stan"
"We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen."
"Grandpa"
"I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?"
"Cartman"
"Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!"
"Stan"
"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes."
"Cartman"
"Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang."
"Stan"
"I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die."
"Kyle"
"I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance."
"Stan"
"Hey, yeah!"
"TV Announcer"
"And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access."
"Jesus"
"Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace."
"Jesus"
"First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'."
"Caller"
"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
"Jesus"
"Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback."
"Caller"
"Oh, sorry."
"Caller"
"Uh, this is Martin..."
"Jesus"
"Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know."
"Martin"
"How the hell'd you know that?"
"Jesus"
"Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?"
"Martin"
"Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-"
"Jesus"
"Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance."
"Martin"
"Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus."
"Jesus"
"Next caller, you're on the air."
"Stan"
"Jesus?"
"Jesus"
"Yes my son?"
"Stan"
"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?"
"Jesus"
"My son..."
"Stan"
"Yes?"
"Jesus"
"I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole."
"Jesus"
"Next caller."
"Stan"
"Goddammit!"
"Jesus"
"I heard that."
"Stan"
"What the hell is wrong with everybody?"
"Cartman"
"Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!"
"Kyle"
"Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?"
"Stan"
"Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!"
"Cartman"
"Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer."
"Kyle"
"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
"Cartman"
"Oh, biiitch."
"Cartman"
"Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh."
"TV Announcer"
"And now back to Terrance & Phillip."
"Terrance"
"Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans."
"Phillip"
"Oho yeah, I love beans."
"Cartman"
"Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming."
"Grandpa"
"Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa please?"
"Stan"
"Okay grandpa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV."
"Terrance"
"Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart."
"Phillip"
"Well, don't fart on me Terrance."
"Cartman"
"Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again."
"Kenny"
"(Oh my God!)"
"Cartman"
"Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny."
"Phillip"
"You're such an asshole, Terrance."
"Terrance"
"Haha, that I am!"
"Kenny"
"(Ow!)"
"Cartman"
"Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart."
"Shelly"
"Jesus! What the hell are you doing?"
"Stan"
"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it."
"Shelly"
"No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!"
"Grandpa"
"Tug - a - little harder, Billy."
"Stan"
"Aaah!!"
"Grandpa"
"Uh, ow."
"Shelly"
"You little jerk!"
"Shelly"
"You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!"
"Grandpa"
"Dammit! I was so close."
"TV Announcer"
"Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather."
"Talk Show Host"
"Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?"
"Stan"
"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and..."
"Talk Show Host"
"Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame."
"Sheila"
"These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!"
"Crowd"
"Woooo!"
"Townsman"
"Huh? Oh god! Oh god!"
"Sheila"
"We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!"
"Sheila"
"We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!"
"Sheila"
"We want more quality television, like Full House."
"Randy"
"Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison."
"Mr. Garrison"
"No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me."
"Randy"
"Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh."
"Mayor McDaniels"
"I just had a brown baby boy."
"Stan"
"Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around."
"Kyle"
"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever."
"All"
"Whoopeee!"
"Grandpa"
"Come here Billy, I want to show you something."
"Stan"
"Aww, do I have to?"
"Grandpa"
"Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me..."
"Grandpa"
"...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa."
"Stan"
"Hey, what are you doing?!"
"Kyle"
"What are they doing in there?"
"Cartman"
"I don't know."
"Grandpa"
"Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?"
"Stan"
"Uh, I guess."
"Stan"
"Okay, you, you can let me out now."
"Grandpa"
"Not just yet."
"Stan"
"Let me out grandpa!"
"Stan"
"I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time."
"Grandpa"
"That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa."
"Singer"
"
'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'

"
"Stan"
"Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand."
"Grandpa"
"So now will you kill me Billy?"
"Stan"
"Sure I will grandpa, I will."
"Liane"
"Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working."
"Sheila"
"It'll work, it has to."
"Townsman"
"Look! It's the president of the network."
"John Warzog"
"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network."
"John Warzog"
"Fuck you."
"John Warzog"
"Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there."
"Sheila"
"Hey, you will not get away with this!"
"Sheila"
"That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'."
"Liane"
"Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?"
"Sheila"
"Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?"
"Liane"
"[Lustily.] Ohhh, yes, indeedy."
"Stan"
"Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. [To Kyle.] You got the cow all tied up?"
"Kyle"
"Yep, all done."
"Stan"
"'Kay, come on guys."
"Cartman"
"Why don't we just shoot him?"
"Stan"
"You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted."
"Kyle"
"Yeah, stupid!"
"Grandpa"
"That's good Billy, a little higher now."
"Cow"
"Moooo!"
"Sheila"
"The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?"
"Sheila"
"Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!"
"Sheila"
"We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes."
"Stan"
"Are you ready grandpa?"
"Grandpa"
"Does the pope crap in the woods?"
"Police Radio"
"7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52."
"Cow"
"Mooo!"
"Officer Barbrady"
"Carry on."
"Stan"
"Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you."
"Grandpa"
"Uhh, cut the damn rope already!"
"Stan"
"What is that?!"
"Kyle"
"Well, it, it looks like..."
"All"
"Death!"
"Death"
"Mrrrrr!"
"Grandpa"
"It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore."
"Grandpa"
"Come on, let's go."
"Grandpa"
"What the...?"
"Stan"
"Hey, he's coming towards us."
"Kyle"
"Why is Death coming after us?"
"Death"
"Mrrr."
"Kids"
"Ahhh!"
"Cartman"
"Aaaah, runrunruuun!"
"Death"
"Mrrr."
"Kyle"
"What are we gonna do?"
"Death"
"Mooorrrr!"
"Newscaster"
"As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors."
"Sheila"
"Here Carol, I think it's your boy."
"Sharon"
"Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?"
"Stan"
"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!"
"Sharon"
"Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there."
"Stan"
"Yeah, but, mom!"
"Sharon"
"Here honey, talk to your father."
"Randy"
"Did you turn the heat down?"
"Stan"
"Dad, Death is coming!"
"Randy"
"Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather."
"Death"
"Mrrrr!"
"Stan"
"Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place."
"Kyle"
"Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids."
"Kenny"
"(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)"
"Kyle"
"Totally dude."
"Stan"
"Good point man."
"Death"
"Mrrrr!"
"Stan"
"Ahhhh!"
"Kyle"
"Quick, jump through the window."
"Cartman"
"Ehh, eh, ehhhh!"
"Death"
"Mrrrr!"
"Kids"
"Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!"
"Grandpa"
"Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!"
"Kids"
"Aaaah!"
"Kyle"
"Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!"
"Grandpa"
"Come over here you son of a whore!"
"Phillip"
"Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?"
"Terrance"
"Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?"
"Phillip"
"Oh, you farted."
"Terrance"
"Ohho God."
"Terrance"
"Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?"
"Phillip"
"No Terrance, why don't you tell me?"
"Terrance"
"Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!"
"Stan"
"[Noticing.] Hey look!"
"Phillip"
"Oh, there's one."
"Newscaster"
"Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is..."
"Newscaster"
"Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!"
"Townsman"
"Wait, wait."
"John Warzog"
"Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked."
"John Warzog"
"Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers."
"John Warzog"
"Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!"
"Townsman"
"Huh, oh no!"
"Sheila"
"At last, now we can return to normality."
"Terrance"
"Hey Phillip."
"Phillip"
"Yes Terrance?"
"Terrance"
"Is there a penny stuck in my butt?"
"Phillip"
"Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check."
"Cartman"
"Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on."
"TV Announcer"
"We interrupt this program to bring you loud static."
"Death"
"Mrrrrr!"
"Kids"
"Ahhh!"
"Kyle"
"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!"
"Stan"
"Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time."
"Grandpa"
"Hey, you were supposed to kill me!"
"Death"
"Mrrr."
"Grandpa"
"That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it."
"Stan"
"Whoa!"
"Great-Great-Grandpa"
"Billllyyyy..."
"Grandpa"
"Grandpa?"
"Great-Great-Grandpa"
"That's right, Billy."
"Grandpa"
"My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?"
"Great-Great-Grandpa"
"I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo."
"Grandpa"
"Limbo?"
"Great-Great-Grandpa"
"I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes."
"Grandpa"
"But I've been waiting for 25 years."
"Great-Great-Grandpa"
"Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes..."
"Stan"
"Come on you guys, let's go home."
"Sheila"
"Here they are!"
"Randy"
"Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won."
"Stan"
"What do you mean?"
"Sharon"
"We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air."
"Cartman"
"You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!"
"Sheila"
"But look what they put on."
"TV Announcer"
"And now back to She's the Sheriff."
"Cartman"
"Ohhh, God, No!"
"Suzanne Somers"
"You are the one behind all these shenanigans."
"Dude"
"Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it."
"Sheila"
"What did he say?"
"Suzanne"
"Up yours, butt-munch."
"Sheila"
"Whatwhatwhaaat!!!"
"Sheila"
"Come on everybody, back to New York!"
"Kyle"
"Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?"
"Stan"
"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes."
"Cartman"
"My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool."
"Kyle"
"Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?"
"Stan"
"Cool!"
"Cartman"
"Yeah!"
"Stan"
"What are you doing grandpa?"
"Grandpa"
"I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?"
"Stan"
"That's my silly grandpa."
