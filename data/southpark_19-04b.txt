"[Morning in CtPaTown, renamed Shi Tpa Town. A bright sun rises over City Foods. People mill around all over the area. The Stotches walk past Skeeter's Wine Bar while the Tuckers, without Craig, walk towards Whole Foods. In the parking area in front of the store two old friends greet each other]
"
"Mornin' Randy!
"
"Mornin' Ger! Just another day in paradise, huh?
"
"Yeah. Look at all the new restaurants the Whole Foods has brought in. [turns around and points at the restaurant behind them.] Let's try out that one there. [they walk towards it and reach the entrance. A greeter awaits them]

"
"Hi. Two of us. please?
"
"Yeah, sorry guys. we got about a thirty minute wait.
"
"[switches places with Randy] Oh, uh, scuse me. [whispers into the greeter's ear]
"
"Yes, sir, give me a second; I'll have a table right away. [rolls his eyes and walks off]
"
"Whoa, what'd you say to him?
"
"I just... told him who I am.
"
"Who are you?
"
"[whips out his phone and shows Randy the Yelp app] I'm a yelp reviewer. I usually keep it on the down-low so they don't kiss my ass too much.
"
"[returns and gets two menus] Right over here, sir. [takes them to their seats]
"
"Alright guys, welcome to (vernacular)
"
"Thanks, uh, did they mention to you that I am a Yelper?
"
"Yes, we've been alerted. Sir.
"
"Greeeat. Could you have them turn up the lights a little, please? [the waiter goes away]
"
"Oh, look at it, Gerald. All the new families moving in. [a new Mexican restaurant - Nueva Familia - is having its grand opening across the street] Our little town is all grown up.
[Nueva Familia, across the street. A family-run restaurant. A boy sweeps up in the kitchen as his mother prepares some tacos on the griddle. His father rushes in.]

"
"Where's that other taco plate? We need it now.
"
"I'm a little overwhelmed.
"
"I know. But we've put everything into moving here and starting this business, and we have to be impressive. [walks up to the boy and gets down on one knee] David, you must help your mama however you can. We're not going back to that miserable place!
"
"I don't wanna go back either.
"
"Okay, done.
"
"Great! [rises and goes for the plates] We really have to impress this customer. He's a local food critic. [rushes the plates out to the dining area]
"
"Another one?
"
"[The dining area. Cartman is eating away. Before him are three plates. One has two burritos, the second has two tacos and some chips and guacamole, the third has two enchiladas which he hasn't touched yet. Ambient Mexican music plays]
"
"[rushes to his table with two plates of food] Okay, here you go, amigo! Another taco plate and the taquitos.
"
"Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?
"
"Yes, you mentioned that several times.
"
"Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard. [whips out his phone] I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars.
"
"Really?
"
"[wiping his mouth clean with his napkin] Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star.
"
"Ohnono. No 1 star, please. What could we do to-?
"
"Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts.
"
"Let me get that for you.
"
"Great, and can you turn down the music a bit? [taps his left ear a few times] This pagan shit hurts my ears.
"
"Of course! [turns around and hurries away. A spritz is heard, and the camera shows David wiping down a table. Cartman notices]
"
"Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor. [snaps his fingers and whistles] Busboy!
"
"My name is David. (Dah-veed)
"
"Ehexcuse me?
"
"I said my name is David. (Dah-veed)
"
"Uhh, it's actually pronounced ""David,"" okay?
"
"Well, I'm ""David."" (Dah-veed)
"
"It's ""David,"" dude. Look it up.
"
"[comes out with a flan and a sundae on a plate] What's going on? Do not argue, son. We need him. [walks to Cartman's table and sets the desserts down] Here you are, a few free desserts. [the front door opens and some bells are heard] Ho, excuse me. More customers! [goes away]
"
"[enters with his wife] Hi, two of us for lunch, please.
"
"Yes, right away!
"
"Oh, and uh, I just wanted to mention that my wife and I are Yelp reviewers, so uh, your best table, please.
"
"Oh Jeez, you guys too, huh? Ho-kay, uhm, I'll get you set up right over here, okay? [takes them past Cartman, who casts a critical eye]
"
"Mmmhmmm! [The father takes them to a booth near Cartman]
"
"Hm, this place seems, nice.
"
"I guess we'll see.
"
"D'I guess we'll see, won't we?
"
"Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic.
"
"[South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Cartman puts his books in his locker and walks away when Butters catches him]

"Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Huh?

"[wearing a T-shirt that says ""WARNING: YELP critic"" on the front] Here you go. [takes a bag out of his back pocket and hands it to Butters]
"
"Whoooaaa. [opens the bag and begins eating what's inside.]
"
"Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
"
"How do you do it, Eric?
"
"I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want.
"
"Jeeeeezzz. [a second later, Kyle walks by with David]
"
"So the cafeteria's back that way, and most of the classrooms are this way, down the-.
"
"EEWW. [Kyle and David face him] What's the busboy doing here?
"
"David is new to our school.
"
"Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school? [mimics a boy on a bicycle] Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?
"
"Shut up.
"
"Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant two stars, but it could have been worse.
"
"Why'd you only give them two stars?
"
"I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all.
"
"It's not supposed to have water you-!
"
"It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David.
"
"David.  (Dah-veed)
"
"David.
"
"Dah-víd.
"
"David.
"
"Dah-víííd.
"
"David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude. [David turns around and walks away. Kyle turns around, looks at Cartman, and follows David away. A few second later Cartman relaxes] ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic.

"[The Broflovski house, day, Gerald's den. Gerald is typing away at his computer. To help him focus on his work, he plays some opera music and smokes a pipe]
"
"And yet, there was more. For in this crisp time when autumn begins to fade, the chef brings chicken in habanero, and even adds habanero powder to the crust. But the heat is restrained. You experience the fruity, delicious flavor of this without any spicy pain. I don't need any more pain. Hell, does anyone?
"
"[appears at the den doorway with Ike] Gerald! We're going to the park. You wanna come along?
"
"Sorry honey, this review for Applebee's has turned into a fifty-pager. And then I have a polish on Ruby Tuesday's.
"
"Why don't you take a break from Yelping, Gerald? You seem a little overwhelmed.
"
"[leans back on his chair] I am, overwhelmed. Sometimes I don't know what I've gotten myself into. But now everyone relies on my Yelp reviews and I... I don't wanna let anyone down.
"
"Well there's chicken in the fridge if you get hungry.
"
"Thanks, but I, I've gotta Yelp a new place in CtPaTown tonight. [leans forward a bit] God I'm so damned tired.
"
"Okay. Have fun.
"
"[to himself]Ha, ""fun,"" she says.
"
"In finality, I will say that my experience at Applebee's was sublime and my treatment near that of a gladiator most decorated. But the street parking wasn't that great. Two and a half stars.
"
"[satisfied with his review Gerald leans back in his chair again commenting to himself] Yes.
"
"[The school cafeteria, day. Wendy walks by with a new classmate. Cartman is on his phone while the boys around him go about eating their lunches]

"
"Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food.

"O-okay, Here you are sir! There's orange-peel chicken, some uh shity beef, and uh shitty egg roll!

"Are you joking?!

"Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.

"Yes yes. I get the fuck out. Thank you! [hurries away]
"
"Wow! Well you're pretty important, Eric.
"
"He's not important. At. All.
"
"Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?
"
"Stop it.
"
"What? I just want to hear him say ""Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool.""
"
"Sí, me ride me teeny bicicleta to school.

"There's no time to sleep when the city's counting on me.

"
"I had a bad experience at Red Lobster and if the people don't know about it, they could too. Folks deserve to know where to eat, Mitch.
"
"But does anyone even thank you for it?

"Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
