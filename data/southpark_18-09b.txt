"[Kyle's house, day. Kyle runs home excitedly with something in his hand. He opens the front door and goes in. Gerald spots him]
"
"There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
"
"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
"
"It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
"
"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
"
"All right. [Kyle smiles, Gerald heads back to the kitchen] I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
"
"Yes! [runs upstairs smiling.]
"
"[Ike's room. Ike is at his computer eating Cheetos. Kyle knocks, then goes into the room]
"
"Heeey Ike! Look what I got. [Ike looks over his shoulder] The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
"
"[on the monitor] Aww, look at all the bright colors.
"
"...Meh. [goes back to watching the monitor and eating his Cheetos]
"
"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
"
"Maybe later, 'kay?
"
"[walks up to Ike] Well what are you watching?
"
"How's it goin' bros? My name's PewDiePie. I'm playing Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Here we go. [breaks through a door and is met with gunfire] Agh! People are shooting at me, bros!
"
"You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
"
"[claps] PewDiePie!
"
"There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
"
"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
"
"All right, I hope that's enough.
"
"Meh.
"
"Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig! [fires away at will]
"
"[South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunchtime]
"
"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
"
"What's a PewDiePie do?
"
"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
"
"He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
"
"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!

"[Randy's garage, night. Randy runs inside to call someone in private]
"
"Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
"
"Come on, this is a great lineup.
"
"Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
"
"I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
"
"What is that supposed to mean?
"
"I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
"
"Yes, Freemium gaming.
"
"I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush. [Randy sighs] You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over. [hangs up. Randy ends the call]
"
"I love Candy Crush.

"[The bus stop, day. The boys are there waiting for the bus]
"
"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
"
"(Commentary?)
"
"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! [Cartman eyes his phone with Stan and Kenny look at Kyle]
"
"[Cartman's room, later. He's set up a YouTube channel and is now broadcasting on it]
"
"Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. [a recording of the earlier conversation plays]
"
"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
"[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
"
"(Commentary?)
"
"There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!

"Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! [anxiously waits for an answer]
"
"I don't know, Shelly.
"
"But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! [Randy and Sharon turn around]
"
"Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
"
"She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
"
"And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
"
"That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!
"
"You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
"
"So can I go or not?!
"
"If she means that much to you.
"
"Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. [smiles and walks away]
"
"Sooo you're doing it? [smiles]
"
"How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
"
"Of course not. [Randy walks away and out of earshot] Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
"
"[Ike's room, later. Ike is still at his computer eating Cheetos]
"
"Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
"
"[goes into the room] Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
"
"More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
"
"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
"
"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.

"
"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.

"[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.

"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!

"But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?

"What do you think you're doing?!
"
"Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
"
"You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
"
"I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
"
"I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
"
"What are you talking about?
"
"This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
"
"Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.

There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
And I'm movin' my hands while I'm shakin' my tits.


"
"Alright guys, Uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde. [walks out of the dressing room backwards] Have a great show, ladies.
"
"Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
"
"You're nervous, it's understandable.
"
"No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
"
"You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit.
"
"Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
"
"Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!
"
"No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
"
"That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!
"
"Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
"
"'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!

"Fuck you! [they start fighting and break through a table full of finger good and drinks]

"You're not gonna believe this.

"Oh no, what now?

"Yeah?

"Come on! [leads Stan upstairs]

"[Ike's room. There are five other kids beside Ike in his room, and each one is using a tablet or a laptop, so no one is talking. Ike is watching PewDiePie on his monitor]
"
"[giggling] He's just laying there.
"
"See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.

"I'm going ""Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun.""
"
"[in unison] PewDiePie!
"
"And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.

"Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.

"Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
"
"CartmanBrah!

"Grandpa?

"This is how they talk to us! [to Conner] You'd better watch your mouth, kid!

"Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember?

"It's best to just make old people think they matter.

"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
"
"No sir. Thank goodness we have you to do that. [Ike laughs at PewDiePie's gameplay]

"And, cue the hologram! [a bunch of special lights come on and produce the hologram, and the hologram performs Michael's signature moves. The crowd goes wild as Michael's music plays. The hologram moonwalks like Michael did]

"Hee hee. [as the crowd roars, Iggy starts twerking to the hologram]
"
"They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.

"Thanks for loving me. I love you too.

"So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy?? [the audience cheers in agreement] Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! [Instead of Cartman himself appearing on the couch, Cartman's commenter window pops up - he's doing this via satellite]

"CartmaaanBrah!"
"So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
"
"Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.

"And why do you think young people-?

"CartmaaanBrah!"
"...Why do you think young people are responding to this? [Cartman mocks the question by asking it back in nonsense syllables] I'm asking you a question! [Cartman continues with the nonsense replies]

But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy. [the mood of the audience begins to change] Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya. [the audience begins to boo] And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh. [turns right and the mic falls to the ground] Oh God. Sorry. [bends over to pick up the mic...] Uh hold on.[...but drops the guitar instead.

Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! [the boos are replaced by disgust. Shelly and friends are disappointed]

"
"Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan? [Stan reaches to his left and passes the potatoes to Randy] Great, thanks. [serves himself some potatoes] Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
"
"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
"
"I was told to!
"
"You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
"
"Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! [Stan hisses and leaves the table. Sharon just leaves. Some time later, Randy drops in on Shelly in her room and sees her crying on her bed, face down.

"Yes. That might be our only option.

"Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha!

"
"Sit down, Lorde.
"
"I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
"
"[stands up and walks to a nearby bar] Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more. [pours himself a drink] Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on. [turns around] The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level.
"
"Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.

"On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
"
"I'll do no such thing!

"Who said anything about you? [whips out a small remote control and presses a button on it. Some lasers turn on and assemble a new hologram. It's Lorde's hologram.
