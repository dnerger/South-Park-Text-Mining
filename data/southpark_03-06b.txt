"
"Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
"
"About what?
"
"Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means? [Cartman raises his hand] Yes, Eric?
"
"When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
"
"...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda. [Petey enters]

"[to Stan] This is freaking me out, dude.
"
"[shows another picture of two pandas...] And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda.

"Ohh, dude, get me out of here!

"I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
"
"You would think that, you little ass-sucker.
"
"What did you call me?
"
"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
"
"[indignant] That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
"
"Uh-oh.
"
"What?
"
"You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
"
"That's right, he can.

"No you can't, you little ass-sucker!

"[South Park Courthouse, day. The Honorable Judge Julie presiding]
"
"This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?
"
"Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
"
"[sitting by Stan] Dude! He got a lawyer?
"
"[entering] Sorry I'm late.
"
"Dad?!
"
"Oh! Hi, Kyle. [moves to Cartman's side]
"
"All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school.
"
"Th... That is correct, my honor.
"
"Hoh, whatever! [rests his head on his left hand]
"
"He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
"
"I called you an ass-sucker!
"
"Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset. [sniffs, Gerald comforts him] I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. [hides his face in Gerald's coat and begins sobbing]
"
"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
"
"As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.
"
"Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?
"
"Wwhat do you mean?
"
"I need to hear your defense.
"
"Uh... I'm eight?
"
"All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty.
"
"Huh?
"
"All right, we did it!
"
"Hooray!
"
"Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately.
"
"I have to give him half my stuff?
"
"Sweet..!
"
"[Marsh residence. Cartman is present with Gerald and a collector in Stan's room]
"
"Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game [on the cabinet next to the door. The collector puts it into Cartman's box], and that Power Jim doll. [goes to Stan's toy box] And, let's see... [pulls out a Mega Truck] Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?
"
"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.
"
"Oh, well, I'll just take that, then. [tosses it into his box and reaches for a lizard] And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?
"
"Uh, no! I hate that toy!
"
"Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! [tosses it into his box]
"
"Damnit!
"
"[approaches Gerald with two toys] Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football.
"
"Hm. [drops them and walks to Cartman] You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
"
"Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
"
"Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools. [Cartman looks through Stan's drawers] Perhaps we should sue them next.
"
"What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
"
"Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
"
"Interesting. [the collector picks up a can and presses a button on it] Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. [rushes to grab it]
"
"[Courthouse, day. The gavel sounds. Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Immediate Party]
"
"Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
"
"No, I had no freakin' idea!
"
"Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?
"
"Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!
"
"You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat.
"
"I'm sorry, toots.
"
"Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?
"
"Yes.
"
"And you did nothing.
"
"Well, he is a little ass-sucker. [the audience laughs]
"
"[gaveling twice] Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!
"
"Okay, baby, I'm sorry.
"
"[Later that day. Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Responsible Party]
"
"Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?
"
"Well, not any more than any other student.
"
"Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
"
"I don't know!
"
"You don't know?! You're the principal!
"
"I can't be around every second!

"
"All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!! [beaks down on the stand] OH GOD!!!
"
"Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?
"
"[composes herself] I believe so, yes. [the audience begins to murmur]

"
"Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?
"
"Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment.
"
"And who's to blame?
"
"I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible.

"There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!

"Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.

"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
"
"Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.

"[thinks a bit] And you don't see a problem with that?

"No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.

"Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.

"Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody.
"
"Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you. [The courtroom is silent, listening] There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. [reactions are seen in the faces of various people in the courtroom, even in Gerald's face.]
"
"I'm a sad panda, too.
"
"I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault! [people get angry at Gerald]
"
"[rises] Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!
"
"[rising] Yeah!
"
"[approaches Petey and the boys] No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!

"Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!
"
"Hooray!
"
"Pandas love ice cream. [Gerald, Petey, and the boys leave the courtroom]
"
"Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed! [gavels and leaves the bench]
"
"[people in the audience leave] Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
"
"[passing by] God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up.
"
"[End of act three. Time: 20:55]

"Hello, cubs. I'm ""Don't Sue People"" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now. [walks off]
"
"[End of Sexual Harassment Panda.]
