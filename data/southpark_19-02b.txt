"[The White House, day. President Obama delivers a speech in the East Room to the press]
"
"Now, last week we were all reminded that intolerance still exists in our country. It took a very special young student to light up social media, and we've invited him to the White House today to show our appreciation. Because never have there been more tolerant, more moving words than Kyle Broflovski's speech about his hero Caitlyn Jenner. [applause. Kyle is shown with his eyes half-closed - an indication that he doesn't want to be there.] Come on up here, Kyle.
"
"[Crunchy's Micro Brew, during the speech. Mr. Garrison is seated with Mr. Adler and Jimbo at a table looking at a TV monitor above the bar.]
"
"You see?? There! This is why it's happening! Everyone's preachin' openness and acceptance, and so now millions of goddamned immigrants are comin' over the border and nobody seems to care!
"
"Well what are you gonna do? In today's world it's like you can't even say anything negative about illegal immigrants.
"
"[Approaching and gesturing like a siren] Weoo weoo weoo weoo weoo! Did somebody over here say ""illegal immigrants""? Because the correct term is ""undocumented immigrants,"" alright bro? [leaves]
"
"[hushed] It's like nobody cares! And they just keep comin'. Crossin' the border with their dirty families, playin' their stupid music! [looks to his left] I mean, look at 'em! I'll bet not ONE of them is here legally! [a group of Canadians is playing pool.]
"
"Alright guy!
"
"Hey buddih!
"
"Hey buddih!
"
"[the shooter] Hey, what's going on fwiend!
"
"[Wearing a Canada sweater] Hey, buddih! Another Moosehead, eh?
"
"We should have put up a goddamned wall. [Jimbo and Richard now look at the Canadians as well]
"
"But wait, there's still more, [the three man now look at the TV] because this country was built on dreamers, and Kyle, we want to make your dreams come true. And so here is your hero, Caitlyn Jenner. [applause as Caitlyn joins Barack and Kyle at the podium. Kyle is taken aback]
"
"[with a lisp] I just wanna say thank you Kyle for your beautiful words of support.
"
"Now Kyle, we've got another little surprise for you. We told you we were flying you back home, but the truth is, you're getting a ride back all the way with your hero! How do you like that?! [Ooohs and applause follow.]
"
"[Caitlyn Jenner's car, outside, moments later. She's ready to take Kyle home, while Kyle looks bewildered.]
"
"Buckle up, buckaroo! [Revs up and speeds away. Almost immediately an elderly person crosses her path and she runs her over, thoroughly killing her under her wheels. The press applauds.]
"
"[South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Garrison enters his classroom along with his students.]
"
"Okay children, let's take our seats. As you've probably noticed, our government has decided to let anyone who wants to, cross the border and screw up our country! [before him is a crowded room, with more desks and lots of new Canadian students.] I know you're all as pissed off as I am, so why don't we begin today's lesson on why the once-great empire of Rome, fell to shit! Huh?! Who can tell my why Rome fell to shit?! [all the Canadian kids raise their hands] No, somebody who matters! [the Canadian students begin to clamor. Garrison puts his left hand over his nose and closes his eyes] Alright, fine, in the orange shirt.
"
"[orange shirt] The Roman Empire, buddy, was facing ehh several issues, guy, as they reached the new millennium, friend, and rather-
"
"[irritated] Oh, speak in English! You see, [turns around and begins writing on the board] what happened is that these immigrants called Goths [writes the word and circles and underlines it] were welcomed into Roman territories [writes the word Roman on the board] because some people felt bad for them. [another Canadian boy checks his watch and hops off his seat, opens a small case and pulls out a trumpet] And then the Goths suddenly decided they were being oppressed, you see, and so then- [the boy begins to play a familiar tune, and Mr. Garrison turns around] What the hell are you doing?! [the other Canadian kids get out of their seats and whip out their trumpets to play the song]
"
"[in a suit] It's 8am, guy.
"
"[loses his temper,throws his notes and chalk] Well that's it! Why don't you Canucks go back where you came from?! [they stop and look aghast at him]
"
"[The Principal's office, moments later. PC Principal is behind his desk with Mr. Mackey at his right side. PC Principal is barely containing his temper. Mr. Garrison is looking at him defiantly with arms crossed]
"
"You really think you can refer to an undocumented immigrant as a ""Canuck""?!
"
"PC Principal, they got up in the middle of my lecture and started playing music!
"
"So did you forget that at eight and eleven all Canadians face east and play Chuck Mangione? [stands up and puts his hands on the desk] Or did you not care to find out about their religious customs?
"
"Thuh, they don't even speak English!
"
"Then you need to be teaching in both languages from now on! Mackey, sign the faculty up for Canadian-language night classes!
"
"What?!
"
"[bowing profusely] Yes, PC Principal! R-right away! M'kay?
"
"You're on thin ice, Garrison! Get in line or you'll be out of a job, bro!
"
"[South Park Elementary cafeteria, lunchtime. Cartman, Kenny, Butters, and Token bring lunches from home while Stan, Kyle, Clyde and Craig get school lunches]
"
"What are they doing now? [several tables have Canadian kids seated and eating. Butters stands up for a better look]
"
"Well they're all eatin' together and praying. A-and they're puttin' syrup on their Mac & Cheese! [sits back down]
"
"Ugh, so weird!
"
"There's just so many of them.
"
"You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
"
"Whattaya mean?
"
"Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
"
"[annoyed] I'm sitting right here.
"
"And he's sitting right here.
"
"You really think just my speech brought on a wave of illegal immigration?!
"
"You did kind of go overboard, dude.
"
"[looks at Stan, betrayed] What?!
"
"It's just... I know you like giving speeches and stuff, but not everything is black and white.
"
"Yeah, I mean, it's fine you wanna go preach about Caitlyn Jenner, but you can't just make blanket statements about letting anyone do whatever they want.
"
"I didn't even want to give that speech!
"
"[interrupting] Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four?
"
"Uhn-un.
"
"Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
"
"Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever.
"
"But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
"
"You guys, immigrants, either legal or illegal, are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living-
"
"[briefly puts his left hand over his nose] Oh boy, here we go again. [the other boys leave as well]
"
"Yeah, I'm out.
"
"Yeah, sorry. I can't listen to another one either. [Kyle is left alone, bewildered]
"
"[South Park Elementary, a different classroom, evening. There are watermarks everywhere, so this room hasn't been used for a while]
"
"Happy evening, friends. My name is Mr. Stkrdknmibalz ,(stick-yer-dick-in-my-balls) and we are going to learn Canadian. [Garrison shifts in his seat] With a lot of practice, you're going to find that speaking Canadian isn't so difficult. And in fact, our alphabet and yours are fairly similar. So why don't we begin singing it together? [Clears his throat]

"[Montage: Mr. Garrison on a bridge overlooking a river. he sees several Canadians enjoying themselves in inner tubes in the river. He sighs and walks away. Next, he's in line to get into the DMV during the day, but the line is full of Canadians. Next, new STOP signs go up that now have BUDDY under the STOP. Mr. Garrison is at the intersection waiting for the green light. A truck pulls up with a bunch of kids in the truck bed, no seat belts. Next, he's at the old town bar singing on a corner stage and playing a guitar. The regulars hold up their fists in solidarity. Next, he passes by a food cart. The cook there is selling beaver tails for five dollars. Then he passes by a newly-sold house with a Canadian couple cheering their purchase. Then he's back at the bar, with more listeners holding up lighters in solidarity. Next, he looks out his window and finds a bunch of supporters on his lawn pleading for him to lead them. Next, he walks by some Canadian kids playing street hockey, then he passes by the school]
"
"
Where has my country gone?
Where has my country gone?
It was a land of opportunity that we held dear
But now all these other assholes are comin' here.
And where's my country gone?
It was just here like, two seconds ago.
'Cause when they said that this was the land of the free
I'm pretty sure that they were referring to me
And my country's gone!
It got upset and now it's wandered away
It took 43 Presidents to make us stand tall
And just one black guy to unravel it all
Country gone!
Please tell it that we need her back home.
There's a great big hole in the liberty bucket
'Cause someone forgot to tell the foreigners to suck it!
And now they're all hanging out on my lawn... [trumpets come up and play ""Feels So Good""]
And now they're ruining my song
Makin' it sound like Chuck Mangione [trumpets fade out]
Where has my country gone?


"
"[Montage ends, and the camera settles on Mr. Garrison leading a rally at the town square, with his supporters around him.]
"
"Seems like everyone's afraid to speak the truth around here! Well I'm throwin' my hat in and sayin' I'll figure this thing out! Now I might not understand politics, or immigration policies, or... the law. Or basic... ideological... concepts. But dammit I understand there there's a bunch of Canadians here and I'm gonna do somethin' about it! [applause and cheers]
"
"[South Park Elementary gymnasium. PC Principal has called the student body in and put the Canadians on the basketball court and the Americans on the bleachers. The Canadian kids are standing in two lines. The front line wear different costumes that represent different time periods and icons in Canadian history, including the First Settlers of Canada, foreign explorers, a Mountie and a Canadian soldier. The second line consists of a band and choir.]
"
"Alright everyone, listen up. In order for better understanding we've asked students of Canadian origin to introduce you to their culture and [spots a disturbance in the stands] HEY LESLIE! SHUT YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! [Leslie stops whispering into her friend's ear and looks at PC Principal] - to introduce you to their culture and customs. So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history.
"
"We are the Hopewell and Abenaki, first settlers of Canadian soil--
"
"Guy.
"
"We are French and British explorers, seeking furs and goods. [Mr. Garrison walks up and takes the mic]
"
"Yeah, and I'm Dan Rather, and I got news for you! Nobody wants you here! [the gym is silent] Sorry not sorry! It's time for someone to say it like it is, and make our country great again!
"
"Garrison, what do you think you're-?
"
"And I'm also not afraid to stand up to PC Principal! You, sir, have a pizza face and you suck your mom's dick!
"
"That's it Garrison! You are fired from South Park Elementary!
"
"Oh, see? And now I'm fired! That's the cold, hard truth of immigration! Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's fuck 'em all to death! [the students gasp] I'm just sayin' what everyone's thinkin' here kids!, Sorry not sorry!
[The school hallway, moments later. The Canadian kids walk out of school in anger]

"
"Dude, the Canadians are pissed off.
"
"Can you really blame them?
"
"What made Mr. Garrison do that?
"
"Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock!
"
"You really think Kyle would do that?
"
"That doesn't matter. We have to think of a way to smooth this over, fast.
"
"Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union.
"
"A what?
"
"You know, what's that story about the two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?
"
"Lion King II?
"
"[snaps his fingers and points to Butters] Yes, Lion King II. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along.
"
"Yeah, it's kind of like when the princess of one country marries the prince of another.
"
"Oh, come on, this is stupid. You guys, when two groups of people don't understand each other you can't just try and diffuse the tension with a little-
"
"Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now? [all quiet] Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?! [the other boys look back at Kyle angrily, and Kyle is left speechless] This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it.

"
"No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT!

"Tom, the political activist is going around the country to get support for his agenda, and- Uh Mr. Garrison, you believe the immigration problem is easy to solve?
"
"Yes. Fuck them all to death. Let'a make this country great again. [cheers swell from his supporters]
"
"And when you say ""Fuck them all to death,"" what are you actually suggesting be done?
"
"I'm suggesting we round them all up, pull down their pants, and fuck them until their spirits leave their bodies!
"
"[wearing a Snap Right Tools cap] USA!
"
"And then, after we've fucked every last one of 'em to death, we build a big wall! And if anyone comes over the wall, we fuck them to death too! And then we fuck to death all the-
"
"Uh Dan? Dan? We're getting word that a wall has already been built. [to the control booth] Is that right? Yes? Yeah- CNN is confirming that Canada has built a wall to keep us out.
"
"What do you mean they built a wall?! They can't build a fucking wall! Oh, fuck them to death!
"
"[Moments later, Garrison and his supporters rush to the border in their cars, where they are met with a very tall wall. A lone guard sits atop the 40-foot wall, and the Americans get out of their cars]
"
"Hey there! Beautiful day, isn't it?
"
"What the hell is this?!
"
"Oh this? This is a wall. Sorry buddih, nobody allowed in.

"Can they do that?

"
"Yeah, no, sorry! Everything past here is ours. You can't, you can't go past, past here.

"We're Americans! We don't even want to be over there! What do you think we're gonna do?
"
"Well, you know, we just don't want you ... raping our women and stuff.

"
"Don't worry aboot it.

"No! What's back there? Let me see!

"[pulling him back] It's all right, Garrison.
"
"No! Goddammit, let me see!

"[South Park Elementary playground, day. The Americans and Canadians have separated into their own cliques. Cartman and Butters stand between the groups checking out the Canadian girls. Butters is still pissed that he lost]
"
"What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot.
"
"She's not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it!
"
"All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?

"Okay! [walks over to the bench with the girl in white shoes next to it] Hi, my name's Butters, what's yours.
"
"I'm Charlotte. [her friends giggle]
"
"Oh Charlotte, I've never done this before. You think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he's still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely begun. We'll run away together and ... and...?

"
"If the Canadian government wants to put up a wall, they have every right.

"And yet, we must ask why they thought this to be necessary.

"No, fuck them and fuck you! [points at the female politician] I wanna see if they have really cool shit back there!
"
"What we need is a-
"
"No! [points at the female politician] You've got a gaping gash [points at the male politician] and you've got vinegary balls! The Canadians can't do this! Don't they realize that hundreds of thousands of their people are over here illegally?

"Well that's what Canadians say to express remorse.

"Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?

"No, we saw a movie and now we're goin' to the park.

"And I suppose you have a thing for Canadian girls, huh? Is that it? You've got maple fever?

"Why would we want to be here?

"Canada has everything. It's the greatest country on Earth.
"
"But- so- then, why did you leave?
"
"[sighs and gets up from the his chair, and walks over to a window] There were several candidates during the Canadian elections. One of them was this brash asshole who just spoke his mind. He didn't really offer any solutions, he just said outrageous things. we... thought it was funny. [the mom begins to cry quietly, and her son comforts her] Nobody really thought he'd ever be President. It was a joke! But we just let the joke go on for too long. He kept gaining momentum, and by the time we were all ready to say ""Okay, let's get serious now. Who should really be President?"" he was already being sworn into office. [turns around] We weren't paying attention. [collapses and begins to cry, bumping into the table against the window] We weren't paying attention!

"You don't got to be sore-y. It's me who should be sore-y. I think everyone has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte.
