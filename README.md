## South Park Text Mining

New insights into South Park


## Motivation

As part of the practical assignment for the course Information Retrieval & Text Mining at Maastricht University, I decided to analyze the tv series South Park.

## Installation

R is required, I also recommend RStudio to execute the scripts.

The libraries imported in each script need to be installed via install.packages("library-name")
